the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life
with you

long, long live
the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you

and i was screaming, long live
all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraidwhen the war has took it's part
when the world has dealt it's cards
if the hand is hard
together we'll mend your heart
because ...

when the sun shines
we'll shine together
told you i'll be here forever
said i'll always be your friend
took an oath
i'mma stick it out 'till the endyou said i'll never leave you alone

you said
i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine

hold on
make it last
never turn back

you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

oh, yeah
how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best viewi'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enoughwish i never hung up the phone like i did
i wish you knew that
i never forget you as long as i'm livin'
and i wish you were right here, right now
it's all good, i wish you would

i wish we could go back
and remember what we were fighting for
and i wish you knew that
i miss you too much to be mad anymore
and i wish you were right here, right now
it's all good, i wish you would

you always knew how to push my buttons
you give me everything or nothing
this mad, mad love makes you come running
stand back where you stoodoh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

and the saddest fear comes creeping in
that you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
till you put me down
oh, i knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there)
so shame on me now (you were right there)
flew me to places i'd never been(oh)
you'll kiss my cheek
i watched you leave
you'll smile, my ghost
i fell to my knees
when you're young you just run
but you come back to what you need

this love is good, this love is bad
this love is a life back from the dead, oh
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me, ohand you looked at me
got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came
and our mamas cried
you said "i do"
and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on the very front porch
after all this time
you and iwe never go out of style

you got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
we never go out of style

take me home
just take me home
yeah, just take me home
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard, i really really hate that...

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burnbut i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
i've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be, at fifteen

la-la-la la-la-la la la la labut i took your matches
before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks
over your sad, empty town

dear john
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home

i see it all now that you're goneto stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
screaming: "i'm in love with you"
wait there in the pourin' rain,
come back for more
and don't you leave,
'cause i know all i need is on
the other side of the door.

with your face,
and your beautiful eyes,
and the conversation,
with the little white lies.
and the faded picture
of a beautiful nighttell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head,in burning red
burning, it was red

losing him was blue like i'd ever known
missing him was dark gray, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red
its two a.m., feelin' like i just lost a friend
hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

i can't breathei hear the preacher say, "speak now or forever hold your peace"
the silence, my last chance
i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but only looking at you

i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl

say "yes", run away now
meet you when out of the church at the back door
wait or say a single vowand i had the best days with you

there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

now i know why all the trees change in the fall
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town
and i said

romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head, i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you, and that's all i really knowit's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
it's fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enoughshe's like, "oh my god"
but i'm just gonna shake
and to the fella over there
with the hella good hair

we can shake, shake, shake
yeah, oh

'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off (whoo)

back up, baby, back up

'cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

oh, i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at allradiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord at thy birth
she's ferocious and she knows just
what it takes to make a pro blush

all the boys think she's a spy
she's got bette davis eyes

and she'll tease you, she'll unease you
all the better just to please you
she's ferocious, and she knows justchose the rose garden over madison square

'cause i loved you from the very first day
it feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news

when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself

it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
whoa, i need you baby

every time you smile, i smilethis year, to save me from tears,

who should be marrying the wrong girl

say "yes", run away now
meet you when out of the church at the back door
wait or say a single vowwaited for something to come along
that was as good as our song

'cause our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"
and when i got home, before i said, "amen"
askin' god if he could play it againi'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read is:

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeanshey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then, why you had to go and lock me out
while i let you in?

(stay) hey, now you say you want it
back now that it's just too late
well could've been easy
all you had to do was (stay)

hey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then, why you had to go and lock me out
while i let you in?baby, and you might still have me

oh, i can't resist
before you go,
tell me this,
was it worth it,
was she worth this?
no, no, no, no, no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all gothe best soy latte that you ever had in may

tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
and head back to the milky way
and tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, ohi used to think that we were forever, ever
and i used to say "never say never..."

...so he calls me up, and he's like, "i still love you," and i'm like, i mean this is exhausting.
you know, like we are never getting back together. like, ever.

no, we are never ever ever getting back together
we are never ever ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back togetheryou never did give a damn thing, honey
but i cried, cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody,
if i died, died for you, died for you

oh, what a shame
what a rainy ending,
given to a perfect dayi run my fingers through your hair
and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me
it's just strong enough to make you feel right
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow
i'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalkso many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing you
like it's killing me, yeah
but i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing youi'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enoughyou're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying

so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burnyou say sorry just for show
you live like that, you live with ghosts
band-aids don't fix bullet holes
you say sorry just for show
you live like that, you live with ghosts

mmm, if you love like that blood runs cold
'cause baby, now we got bad blood
you know it used to be mad love
so take a look at what you've done
'cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the timeremind me how it used to be
pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
and say you want me, yeah, yeah

and then you say
i want you for worse or for better
i would weep for ever and ever

and that's how it works
it's how you get the girl, girl

i'll be you're everything tonight
let me love you, kiss you
oh baby let me miss youhold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high and you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows,
that you cry,
but, you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but, you're coming undoneit drives you crazy
but you know you wouldn't change
anything, anything, anything

i really do believe in you
let's see if you believe in me

santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
'cause i'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
this is a big world, that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to catch me nowif what you are is a daydream,
i'll never get to hold
at least you'll know

you're beautiful
every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my front door
oh, but, if it don'ti got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town
and i said

romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come

he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you, and that's all i really knowthat'll have to be something i just say this year

bet you got your mom another sweater
were your cousins late again?
when you were putting up the lights this year
did you notice one less pair of hands?every one of us has messed up, too
lives change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new

it's all right, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowdand you looked at me

forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red
and we walk down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
for the first time, what's past is past

'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid100 mile an hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind

you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your doorthey are the hunters
we are the foxes and we run
just grab my hand
and don't ever drop it, my love

'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"
and when i got home, before i said, "amen"
askin' god if he could play it again
[taylor swift]
what! what! i knit sweaters yo!

[t-pain]
oh, oh

[taylor swift]
what! what! don't test me [bleep]

[taylor swift]
hey hold on, hold on i didn't even say anything

[t-pain]
what?

[taylor swift]
i said "yo"

[t-pain]and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't
so if the chain is on your door, i understand

but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december...all you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

but someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

someday, i'll be, living in a big old citycause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating, intoxicating
complicated, got away by some mistake and now

i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
i'm so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undonehope it's nice where you are

and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind

so i'll go
sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss

woah...
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, woah
soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge

do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'cause i don't think you doyou belong with me

oh i remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong, think i know it's with me

can't you see that i'm the one who understands you?
been here all along, so why can't you
see
you belong with me?
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enoughyou're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard, i really really hate that...

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burnyou're my achilles' heel
this is the golden age of something good and right and real

and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same

i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
in new york, be here
but you're in london
and i break down
this is not fair
that you're not around

and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be hereall you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

but someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

someday, i'll be, living in a big old citystay, stay, stay, stay

stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you
for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny

when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best
if we both stay, stay
stay, stay, stay, stay

stay, stay, stay
i've been loving youyou're my achilles' heel
this is the golden age of something good and right and real

and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same

i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the sameand i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'cause my heart is yours

so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard

so don't you worry your pretty little mindi don't think so, ohh

oh, back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?
back up, baby, back up

'cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

oh, i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at allyou're not sorry, no, no

you had me crawling for you, honey
and it never would have gone away, no
you used to shine so bright
but i watched all of it fade

so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last strawoh baby give me one more chance
(i'll show you that i love you)
i want you please let me,
back in your heartoh, invisible
i just wanna look in your eyes
and make you realise

i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
baby, let me love you
let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
woah...
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, woah
soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge

do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'cause i don't think you dotogether died of thirst

rain came pouring down
when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning
gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean

rain came pouring down
when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breatheand he keeps the picture
of you in his office downtown

and you understand now why they
lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life
tryin' to put it into words

'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence, youand i almost do

and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i
i almost do, i almost domy thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaning to say
i was enchanted to meet you

please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you

this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knowso you're the only thing on my mind?

and i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me, then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around

here's to you and your tempermy thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaning to say
i was enchanted to meet you

please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you

this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knowon a mission
but, i'm ready to fly

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on
just like the ones i used to know
so may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white
all those other girls, well, they're beautiful
but would they write a song for you?

i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain
so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself

if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain
so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met youin front of everyone you know?
and what do you do
when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show?

you should have been here
and i would've been so happy

and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all standing around me singing
"happy birthday to you."you searched the world for something else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end, in wonderland
we both went mad

we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it
could last forever (last forever)

we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse
but never better (never better)

we found wonderland
you and i got lost in itwe'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (over)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the playersand how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't
so if the chain is on your door, i understand

but this is me swallowing my pride

never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy groundi run my fingers through your hair
and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me
it's just strong enough to make you feel right
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow
i'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalkcome back, come back, come back to me like
you would before you said it's not that easy
before the fight, before i let you walk
but i take it all back now

come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
standing in the rain outside until i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by nowthat you'll come in with the rain

i've watched you so long,
screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say

but, i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired tonight for all these games

just for me and you

and i was screaming, long live

and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraidput my name at the top of your list

[gary lightbody]

[taylor swift]

[gary lightbody]

[taylor swift]
you broke my heart in the blink of an eye

[gary lightbody]
you break my heart

[both]
this is the last time asking you
last time i'm asking youbaby, and you might still have me

oh, i can't resist
before you go,
tell me this,
was it worth it,
was she worth this?
no, no, no, no, no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all gowe sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

tonight we stand, get off our knees
fight for what worked for all these years
and the battle was long, the fight of our lives
but stand up champions tonight

it was the night things changed
do you see it now?so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing you
like it's killing me, yeah
but i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing youyou were looking at me
i remember
oh i remember

are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods?

are we in the clear yet?
in the clear yet? good

are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods?

are we in the clear yet?
in the clear yet? good

are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods?superstar

you played in bars, you play guitar
and i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
and you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
every night from the radio

so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of youbaby, and you might still have me

oh, i can't resist
before you go,
tell me this,
was it worth it,
was she worth this?
no, no, no, no, no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all gowaited for something to come along
that was as good as our song

'cause our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"
and when i got home, before i said, "amen"
askin' god if he could play it againon a mission
but, i'm ready to fly

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on
ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
ooh, ooh, dancing with me
ooh, ooh, we could get married
have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

oh my, what a marvelous tune
it was the best night
never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines

and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlightyou said i'll never leave you alone

you said
i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine

hold on
make it last
never turn back

you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
