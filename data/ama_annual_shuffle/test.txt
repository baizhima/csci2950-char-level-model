There's miles of land in front of us
And we're dying with every step we take
We're dying with every breath we make
And I'll fall in line

A stranger's back is all I see
He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line

No one looks up anymore
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line

And about this time every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep

And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question
Why I fall in line

Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head:
Follow me instead

Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:
This line's the only way

And then I start down the stand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says,
Follow me instead

Take me up, seal the door
I don't want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So I'll follow You instead

So then You put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea
[LUPE FIASCO: TALKING]
Uh, what up y'all!
Soundtrack what's popping baby?
Y'all ain't know, I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea, uh!
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying?
Legally and illegally
Hahaha...
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out

[VERSE 1: LUPE FIASCO]
First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yea, when they said, "It's getting late in here..
...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

[CHORUS]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

[VERSE 2: DRAKE]
(Waddup Lupe, Chi Town!)
My style is very Tennessee 
Mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barley remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
But check it gets boring growing up in memphis
Trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
Luckly my aunt working as a nurse
So every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
And plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
If i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work
I tell her i was there on vacation
She say you need to be doing something other than skating
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
I ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
So now its me and old school
Chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
He knew i didn't really wanna post here
Open up the window told me that the coast clear
Now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
Life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes i'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
Kick flip in the air
The kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here
Breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
I say aunty this is a safe career
She said Drake i told you there's no skating here

[CHORUS:]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

[VERSE 3: LUPE FIASCO]
Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"

[CHORUS:]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
Yes
It's so crazy right now
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young

You ready?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

Get up, history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy in love's

Jay-Z
Check it, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony

Soprano, The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phoneys man, you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling dough, If anything I bling yo

A star like Ringo, war like a green beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
Jay-Z in the range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure 'im out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over
To platinum the game's been wrap, one

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, you got me so crazy baby
Hey

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Wohh ho ho oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Wohh oh oh oh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Wohh ho ho oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat

If I'm thinking for two
I've got a lot of sweet drinking up to do
He reminds me of a drummer that I once knew
Just passing through

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I cancelled that call
I thought about it and I want it all
So I picked up the pieces you left on the floor
And went out for more

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I know that we took them by surprise
And I know we were right before their eyes
And it's about time
Yeah it's about time

So I walked through the door
They looked right at me, but could not ignore
And the drinks were expensive, stories were told
And I had a ball

And I cancelled that call
You though about it and you want it all
So you picked up the pieces I left on the floor
And walked out that door

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I know that we took them by surprise
And I know we were right before their eyes
And it's about time
Yeah it's about time
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

Baby I love you, I need you here
With me all the time
Baby we meant to be, you got me
Smiling all the time

You know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go running, running,
Try'na get away from loving you

You know how to love me hard
I won't lie I'm falling hard
Yup, I'm falling for you
But there's nothing wrong with that

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine

Baby come take me now
Hold me now make me come alive
You got the sweetest touch
I'm so happy you came in my life

You know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go running, running,
Try'na get away from loving, yah

You know how to love me hard
I won't lie I'm falling hard
Yup, I'm falling for you
But there's nothing wrong with that

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine

Yes I'm kinda crazy
That's what happens baby
When you put it down you shouldn't'a
Give it to me good like that
Shouldn't'a hit it like that
Had me yelling like that
Didn't know you'd would'a had me coming back

You da one that I'm feeling
You da one that I'm loving
Ain't no other niggas like you
No there's just one, one, one, one,one,one,
No baby just one, one,one,one

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think that I belong to ya
Just too busy running shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretending, stop that fronting
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing
And makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl
And you might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

Drinking, smoking, fucking, plotting
Scheming, plotting, scheming, getting money
Drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting, scheming,
Plotting, getting money

This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build and destroy
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
This the shit I wanna go out to
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
Now, the night
Is coming to an end

The sun will rise
And we will try again

Stay alive
Stay alive for me
You will die
But now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure
To die

I will fear
The night again

I hope I'm not
My only friend

Stay alive
Stay alive for me
You will die
But now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure
To die

So little to say, but so much time
Despite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay, I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new

Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me, first love
Forgive me, forgive me, first love
Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now its over now
And your in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes your were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
Fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired

(I should have known)
Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe the trick me back into them even tho

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
Then I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired
[Drake: Talking]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look,
She Got A Saying Theres No Alice Without The Tin Man
Crib Was 2 Mil, Plus I Just Bought A Couch For Ten Grand
Even If The House Was Ten Grand
And There Was No Pool
Would I Still Be Witout My Swim Fan?
The Ceiling Could Be Higher
She Making Requests
Dont Know If She Feeling Me Or She Be Feelin What I Buy Her
And Purses Are Light Now
She Use Em All The Time
So She Smilin To The The Point That It Hurt When She Bite Down
And She Simply A New Model
Stay Spendin Dollars
But She Got Less Sense Than A Empty Perfume Bottle
At Times She A Solid Chick
And Im A Sucka For The Cuties
So She Always Lookin Good When My Wallets Thick
Chillin On The Linen, She All Up In The Closet So Much
Got A Hunch Thats Shes Feelin Other Women
Want The Diamonds On The Face In The Center
Nice Guys Finish Last So Im Winnin Every Race That I Enter And She A

[Chorus:]
Video Girl

I Bet Shes Out Meetin Directors Instead
And Frustratrated Cuz Shes Already Been Addressed In They Head
Be A Teacher, Open Up Shop If You Can Do Nails Fine
Apply For A Business Loan And I'll Bet You That They'll Sign
If You A Real Dime
Poppin As If Its Your Only Option
Girl Theres Things To Do
Other Than Jail Time
Look This Aint A Song Dissing Half Of These Rappers
Or Pasha And Sasha, Esther Baxter
Melyssa Ford, Or Katy Or Anyone After
I Just Give My Opinion For Laughter
Or Maybe To Think On
So Next Time You Out At The Club
And A Brother Offers The Whole Table Something To Drink On
You Just Take In Effect He Got A Stack With A Mink On
Now He Got You Doing Everything That You Think Wrong
Look, You Tell Your Parents That Its Cash At An Easy Pace
Ya Dad Screaming Take Ya Ass Outta Jeezy Face
And As Ya Man I Wont Back Down First
But They Got You Doing Soft-Core Background Work
That Messed Up Like An Officer That Pulls You Over
And He Ask Questions Later And Pat Down First
But You Aint Thandie Newton, And This Aint Crash Here
The Resolutions Passed Baby, This Aint Last Year
Look, I Got A Message, I'll Say It
I Got Some Beats Still
Regina Hall And Garcelle And Alice Neal
Young Girls These Here Women With Big Dreams
Role Models That You Can Watch On The Big Screen
If You Refuse To Change And You That Chick Still
Respect Yourself, Dont Be Convinced That These Tricks Will
You Got An Audience Believe It Or Not
My Cousin Who Cant Speak Know The Lyrics To Tip Drill

[Chorus:]
Video Girl

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Ariana Grande:
Tell me something I need to know,
Then take my breath and never let it go...
If you just let me invade your space,
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain...

And if in the moment, I bite my lip,
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss;
Give me a reason to believe in...

'Cause if you want to keep me, 
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
And if you really need me, 
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... (Baby, love me harder...)

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...

The Weeknd:
I know your motives, and you know mine;
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind...
If you know about me, and choose to stay,
Then take this pleasure, and take it with the pain...

And if in the moment, you bite your lip,
When I get you moanin', you know it's real...
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make you feel like the first time...

Ariana Grande, [The Weeknd]:
'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder; [I'ma love you harder...]
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... [Baby, love me harder...]

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder... (Gotta love me harder...)

The Weeknd: So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
Ariana Grande: You got to try, try, try again, yeah...
Ariana Grande: I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again...

Ariana Grande, [The Weeknd]:
'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
[I'ma love you, love you, love you...]
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... 
(Love me, love me, baby...)
'Cause if you wanna keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
[Gotta, gotta, gotta...] (Love me harder... love me harder...)
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... 
[I'ma do it, do it, do it... I'ma love you harder...] (Whoo!)

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me... [Love you...]
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
(Oh, baby, love me, love me, baby,) (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Just a little bit harder, harder, baby...) (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
Oooh baby how you doing? 
You know I'mma cut right to the chase 
Some women, were made 
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created 
For a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you, you feel me? 

It's on, baby let's get lost 
You don't need to call into work, 'cuz you the boss 
For real, want you to show me how you feel 
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal 

Why, well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets
You didn't know was inside,
No need for me to lie

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find 
On what I'm working with 
Damn I know, I'm killing you with them legs 
Better yet them thighs 
Matter a fact it's my smile 
Or maybe my eyes 
Boy you a sight to see 
Kind of something like me 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
I talk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
But he love my big ego 
It's too much 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I walk like this 
I, I talk like this 
I, I can back it up 
I can back it up 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talks like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walks like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 

Ego so big , you must admit 
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch 
Ego so strong, if you ain't know 
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold
Oh
She gon' love that... I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
If I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go.
There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts that had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I could not undo
Some things I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
When life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past 'cause it's gone
And you gotta just move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Only if for a night
<div class="lyricbox">Cheers to the freakin' weekend

Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls

I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras

<div class="lyricbox">Once upon a time our world was on fire and I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless, never any limits, guess I had a lot to learn
Cause fire turns to ember, embers to ashes that blow away too soon
k
Now everything’s after you is like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey

Looking back I guess it was really for the best
Still you’re something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go
You’re a habit hard to break
I got used to being high and nothing that I try seems good enough right now

It’s also watered down like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong
You can’t go back and you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey

Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey</div>
In the circles I've been runnin'
I've covered many miles
And if I could search forever
For what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It wasn't nothing like I'd planned
And when I got my heart around it
It slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
Close my eyes and see it

In a midnight talk
In a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms
That's where it is
When we're tangled up 
And can't resist
When we feel that rush
That's where it is....... That's where it is

When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now

Bridge:
It's a lifetime filled
With tiny graces
The biggest things
In the smallest places

In the sweetest smile
On a night like this
In a tender touch
That's where it is
When we're tangled up
And can't resist
When we fill that rush
That's where it is.... That's where it is
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' 'em out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh

Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
[Verse 1:]
I'm not concerned with people 
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad

[Hook:]
Get dem haters out your circle 
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down 
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Verse 2:]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you dont know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

[Hook:]
[Bridge:]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Dont be fooled u betta recognize
They not there for you
They dont care for you
Trust me cuz i know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Hook]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
<div class="lyricbox">She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings that you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

Hotel to hotel, girl -- I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend -- she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes -- don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit -- I put you back in yo place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone</div>

(Hook x2)
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch i go crazy
Im feelin you baby
I dream like this boy whenever we kiss i cant take it
U know i cant fake it
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

On the eve of a day
That's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don't need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
'Cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There's something we need

I'm not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you what I'm sing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore
And that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, no

I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love, I want it I crave it
I just can't get enough

Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I've been let down but never been tainted
So I stay thirsty for more
No I won't hold back no drop is wasted
I let love run it's cours

Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

I'm so intoxicated
I learned the way you taste
On my lips when we kiss

You got me so addicted
So much I can't resist
Falling into your arms

Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

It's all that I need
<div class="lyricbox">Red sun, saltwater dripping haze
Stick-shift, summer Sahara chains
We ain't alone

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Look for the golden sombrero, Puerto Nuevo west
Blondes have a little too much fun, I'll be brunette
Adiós 'til then

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Run, run, run
Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Crossing that border; passport says Jane Doe
For a little while, baby, just lay low
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico
Suntan, seaside, feeling that breeze blow
We'll be sipping that smooth Don Julio
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico, yeah</div>
Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh 
On A star 

And I'm wishing on a star 
To follow where you are 
I'm wishing on a dream 
To follow what it means 
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
I wish on all the people who really dream 
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes. 
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done 
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be 
So far away from home 
So far away from me 
Just think of all the moments that we can spend 
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant 
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know, 
In the game of love, you reap what you sow 

I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby 
When we're together 
Whether or never 
I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby. 
When we're together. 
(Let's get together, baby) 
Whether or never. 

And I'm wishin on a star 
To follow where you are 
And I'm wishing on a dream
Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We hot right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Baby tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever baby I'm yours

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

So close I can taste you
Ain't escape I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Can you feel me
You got me feel it

Something you wanted to do what you like
There's no more waiting tonight is the night
And we can't be wrong not if it feels this right
Turn it up, scream it loud
But we got right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

<div class="lyricbox">Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
You’d be a billionaire in a year
That’s what you gotta think ‘till you’re there, on the record line

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don’t condone it, love is a component
You’re the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Baby, I had a good time, and yes I pop strings
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don’t condone it, love is a component
You’re the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

She growing up aight
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I, I just didn’t think I wasn’t good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I’d get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that
I wasn’t going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren’t perfect
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it’s like he’s perfect and he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition</div>
I love it when we're at a party
In a downtown crowd, oh
But I can hear you call me 'baby'
With the music up loud

Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far, 
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, 
A cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, 
Beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me 
And make me hold my breath

You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, what are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far,
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, 
Beating faster in your chest

And tonight I wanna drive so far,
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background underneath the hardest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place

<div class="lyricbox">Come here
I don't know what happened

Where did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me? or did I lose control?

Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a world baby
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It's been difficult
I’m just happy there's no fights no more
But it’s nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason why this happens for

Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a world baby
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

Bounce
Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a world baby
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down</div>
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

On the eve of a day
That's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don't need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
'Cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There's something we need

I'm not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you what I'm sing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore
And that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'm sorry
Unwrap your heart for me 

'Cause mint condition just means that you haven't been living
Who taught you to be so safe anyways? 
A scar is just a battle wound, it tells the tale of earlier days
Before cold feet, cold feet
Can't tell you your heart won't get broken, but
C'mon now - throw some caution to the wind
I'm throwing it to the wind
You could run away scared 
Or look it straight in the eye 
And tell it "I don't want you coming here no more!"
Don't wait for its reply
Tell me, what are you so afraid of?
Skinned knees and swaying trees?
The world outside? Oh honey, honey, please.
Don't be getting cold feet, cold feet
Can't tell you that your heart won't get broken, but
C'mon now - throw some caution to the wind
I'm throwing it to the wind
You say "You don't know what I've been through!"
Why don't you tell me then, 'cause I'd really like to
Don't keep your heart under lock and key
'Cause if you do it won't find its way to me
To me
I'm throwing it to the wind
I'm throwing it to the wind, oh
I'm throwing it to the wind
Once was a time you and i 
Made a promise till the day we die 
I trusted each and every word 
Never thinkin that I'd get burned 
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales 
Boy i thought that i knew you so very well 
But you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried 
And it cuts like a knife 

(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Theres only time to say goodbye 

Fooled me once shame on you 
Fooled me twice now this song is through 
The things you said i can never forget 
The things you did for my heart went through bad 
But im still standin tall as i walk away 
And you know that its true when you hear me say 
Its over, its through 
And nothin you can do boy its sad but its true 

(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time

Im never gunna hear your lies 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time

Theres only time to say goodbye 

Good Byeee No Baby 
Silly me i believed in your fairy tales 
Boy i thought that i knew you so very well 
But you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried 
And it cuts..like a knife 

(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips) 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies) 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Its over its through nothin you can do and wonder why 
Theres only time to say goodbye 

Baby goodbye 
Never gunna never gunna cry no more 
Goodbye goodbye

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Woah, what now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why

So what now?

And you got me like oh
What you want from me?
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby you got me like oh, mm
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together
And throw me against the wall

Baby you got me like aaah, woo, aaah
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just stop loving me (loving me), babe

Oh, and babe I'm fist fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe?
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Then you keep loving me
Just love me, yeah
Just love me
All you need to do is love me yeah
Got me like ah-ah-ah-ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart?

Baby like aaah, woo, aaah
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just stop loving me (loving me), babe

Your grandpa died
When you were nine
They said he had
Lost his mind
You have learned
Way too soon
You should never trust the pantaloon

Now it's your turn
To be alone
Find a wife
And build yourself a home
You have learned
Way too soon
That your dad is now a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now, 
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
Cuz your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmare and your frights

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind
Baby I see you
That look in your eyes
Hips that keep shakin'
Mysterious style
Exotically attempting
Familiar to me  
That Creole sexy is all over me

So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it creole

So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it creole

I'm steppin' it hotta (hotta hotta hotta yo)
So dont you fight it
So dont you fight it</div>
He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses what he stole on a grave

He pretends he's okay but you should see
Oh him in bed late at night he's petrified
Take me out finish this waste of a life

Everyone one gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch as him fall through a bleeding trapdoor

He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills man faster than his own hand
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

He pretends he's okay but should see
him in bed late at night he's petrified
Take me out and finish this waste of a life

Everyone one gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch as him fall through a bleeding trapdoor

Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone one gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor
Cause nobody know his life
<div class="lyricbox">(Whoa, whoa)
(H-h-here we go)

Center of attention once again
They don’t understand
They don’t understand, no

Then they try to tell me who I am
They don’t understand
They don’t understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can’t be looking for me then
I don't even need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told

I see you thinking 
But there's just one thing de-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand, no

Thinking you're the reason that it ends
But you won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can’t be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs
Is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me 'cause that's not reality
And so I can't be a silhouette of who I'm becoming
You don't know me but there's more to see, my love

You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Untill you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(You don't know me)
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
And you don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
But there's just one thing d-e-e-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love
(My love)</div>
Teach You A Lesson (Remix) Lyrics
Robin Thicke Ft. Drake

[Drake]
Me and you so crucial, baby
and that champagne, so fuchsia, baby
I do things that you ain't used to, baby
I take ya back home and sing Lose Ya, baby
When raindrops hit the tin roof, it's crazy
that's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
Well you all wet, covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like, Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to you if you need that
touch right there, whatever the speeds at
if it's over fast then, then I promise you a relapse
forget what you guessin' I'm on
and who was in your past, I'm fresh n' I grown
just charge that cell that I message you on
and if you let us girl, I'ma bring the dresser along
hear that professional tone, half of that's ice and the rest Patron
show up on time for the class that I'm teaching
cuz guaranteed, I'ma bring a lesson along
and you just gotta bring ya breasts along
instead of holdin' out, wonderin what it coulda been
I confess, this addressed to you
and I'm the postman, looking for a slot I can put it in
with no New York number, mom still upstairs I'm two floors under
but my room soundproof,  you so tempted
to satisfy your urge, so you don't wonder,
yeah, I know I told ya before
I grab that for ya like holdin' the door
cuz mines is Polo and yours is Vicky, and they just spread all over the floor like...

[Robin Thicke]
U feel so good
U smell so good
U feel so warm
Just like I knew u would
I can't let u go

U were late 2 school
I'm gonna have to, see u after class
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have 2 teach u a lesson
Someones gonna have 2 straighten u right out
Someones gonna have 2 teach u
Teach u teach u teach u

You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
you wont get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
you can work it off
Baby I can give you, extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
You were late 2 school
Teach u teach u teach u
Girl can I frisk you?
Search your body for,
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause you're hiding WMDs
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let u go

You were late 2 school
I'm gonna have 2 see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
Someones gonna have to straighten you right out
Someones gonna have to teach u
Teach u teach u teach u

For the moment, for tonight
can I make you mine?
Is it me? is it us?
Can I love you all my life?
You will never know what's behind my skull
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

You will never know what's under my hair
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

You will never know what's under my skin
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

You will never know what is in my veins
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

Won't you go to someone else's dreams
Won't you go to someone else's head
Haven't you taken enough from me
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

And you will never know what I'm thinking of
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

And you will never understand what I believe
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

Haven't you taken enough from me
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?
Won't you go to someone else's dreams
Won't you go to someone else's head.
Haven't you taken enough from me
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I
Don't know where I should go
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply
Taking time in a simple place
In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase
And it's said that a war's lead but I forget
That I let another day go by
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days
I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep.
(Big Boi)
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It's the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

ARE YOU INFATUATED WITH ME
I COULD END YOUR CURIOSITY
IF YOU DON'T THINK I'M TOO RUDE
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO MAKE YOUR MOVE

I SIT AND WAIT FOR NOBODY
PEOPLE SAY THAT MY STYLE IS SO CRAZY
I THINK YOU LIKE IT BABY
DO YOU WANT TO GET NASTY
I DARE YOU TO UNDRESS ME

BABY, LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANNA ROLL 
WITH THIS HIP HOP STAR
BABY I'M GONE FLOW WITH MY PANTS DOWN LOW
I'M A HIP HOP STAR
BABY LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANNA RIDE WITH THIS
HIP HOP STAR
I'M A ROCK STAR

DO I BLOW YOU AWAY?
DO I STIMULATE YOUR MIND
WOULD YOU TASTED MY LOVE IF I KICK IT TIGHT
I HAVE NONE TO WASTE WITH YOU
I GUESS YOU CAN SAY
MY STYLE IS SO CRAZY
I THINK YOU LIKE IT BABY
DO YOU WANT TO GET MESSY
I DARE YOU TO UNDRESS ME

BABY, LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANNA ROLL 
WITH THIS HIP HOP STAR
BABY I'M GONE FLOW WITH MY PANTS DOWN LOW
I'M A HIP HOP STAR
BABY LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANNA RIDE WITH THIS
HIP HOP STAR
I'M A ROCK STAR

UNDRESS ME UNDRESS ME
YOU CAN COME
COME BABY, UNDRESS ME

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root 
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me 'p' pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane,
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!

Hoppin' over the edge
just like Janice Joplin.
River Phoenix,
Jimi Hendrix,
Jimmy Morrison,
All of them ended by
Hollywood
Thank God for Hollywood
Hollywood...

[Outro: Beyonce]
I see your face and a
you wanna touch it and,
come to my place and we
can discuss it..Hollywood,
Welcome to Hollywood.
<div class="lyricbox">Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched your taillights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame
And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away

And you should know
Please, believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long
It's never easy
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say?

How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say

And you should know
Please, believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long
It's never easy
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? （What can I say?）
What can I say? (What can I say?)

I hate to think all you had of me (And I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you
Spaced between what was meant to be (In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into

And you should know
Please, believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
It's been so long
It's never easy
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say? 
What can I say? (What can I say?)</div>
I thought that things like this get better with time, but I still need you... Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind, so I still see you around...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
Said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right, but I still mean them... Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to... Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away... (But you're away...)
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
Now that I have captured your attention
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. T say I'm ready for inspection
Show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
No stop until the morning
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah
Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
No stop until the morning
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
[Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change it, I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show

When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends, when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do

One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

[Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt
By someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost
I just wanna...
Show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true

Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good
Wanna show you how much, how much you're understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me bay

Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo' heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz
It's 'bout to go down

You'll never need two, 'cuz I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you

'Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop-poppin' this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up

And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show
Daddy you know what's up

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz
It's 'bout to go down

Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cuz you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes

While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel

Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz
It's 'bout to go down
Feel the adrenaline
Moving under my skin
It's and addiction
Such an eruption

Sound is my remedy
Feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dancefloor
Bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard
Blazing through my beating heart

French kissing on the floor
Heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy off the crazy juice
This will end up on the news

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Ultrassexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh oh oh ooh oh

Ultrassexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum...

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
If I begged and if I cried 
Would it change the sky tonight 
Would it give me some light 
Should I wait for you to call? 
Is there any hope at all 
Are you drifting by? 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you I, can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 

And when I lie all by myself 
I see your face, I hear your voice 
My heart stays faithful 
And time has come and time has passed 
If its good it's got to last 
It feels so right 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 
You, you disappear 

I missed all the signs 
One at a time you were ready 
What did I know starting our lives 
Now my love, I'm ready to shine 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
You disappear, you disappear 
You disappear, disappear

Uh-huh uh-huh (Shia, Rihanna)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Ho)
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain
I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me
In anticipation
For precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay
Rain man is back
With little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

Rihanna
You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come in to me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, imma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

It's raining, raining
Ooh baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come in to me

Come in to me, come in to me
Come in to me, come in to me</div>
You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phones
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Yes
It's so crazy right now
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young

You ready?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

Get up, history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy in love's

Jay-Z
Check it, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony

Soprano, The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phoneys man, you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling dough, If anything I bling yo

A star like Ringo, war like a green beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
Jay-Z in the range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure 'im out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over
To platinum the game's been wrap, one

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, you got me so crazy baby
Hey

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch

Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
Drake:
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Drake:
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Drake:
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Drake:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Rihanna:
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

Rihanna:
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Drake &amp; Rihanna:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Drake:
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

Drake &amp; Rihanna:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Popcaan:
Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Oh, oh oh ohoh
(And I pray)

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Ooh, I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray yeah
I close my eyes and...

I pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls that need a break
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (and I pray)
I close my eyes and I pray (oh)
ohohoh

I pray (oh, and I pray)
I pray

I close my eyes and pray
I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly
 
I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say

Hello, hello, hello, hello
I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly
 
I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say

Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello, yeah

Hello, hello, hello, hello
[Drake - Verse 1]
Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it

Cap on, brim bent, Denzel every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cards saying fuck ya life

Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double

Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
But I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Drake - Chorus]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]
Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake

Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the peach state
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes

Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed

M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 though at the venue
Pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me

[Chorus]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

[Nicki Minaj]
I mean we don't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag
I mean, I mean but then again
Who looks at the price tag? You know.

[Drake]
Oh yeah, we in this bitch
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside-down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after, happily

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map

This is for them twentysomethin's: Time really moves fast, you were just 16...
This is for them thirtysomethin's that didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be...
This is for them fortysomethin's: Well, raise up yo' glass and laugh like a motherfucker!
This is for them fiftysomethin's: Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head...

Mom and Dad tried to hide the world, said the world's just too big for a little girl;
Eyes wide open, can't you see? I had my first heels by the age of 13!
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys - I swear, that just made 'em want me more;
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be - I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink!"

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna...
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,

Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, all night;
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

This is for them chipper somethin's that's high on life: Baby, put me on your flight!

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna...
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,

I know it costs to be the boss - One day, you'll run the town;
For now, make your life what you decide - Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucker down!

Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna... (Yeah...)
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,

Don't stop runnin' until it's finished... yeah, yeah, yeah...
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten... yay... ay... ay...
<div class="lyricbox">Don’t do it to me
Don’t do it to me
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no

Focused, I’m focused
She got a body like that
I ain’t never seen nothing like that
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That’s right I think she foreign
Think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon’ work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
And I’m down with it
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It’s not hard to notice, that I’m open
Hypnotized by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
And I’m down with it
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time

I, I need somebody (to love)
I need somebody (I swear)
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, gonna need somebody
I need somebody, (I, I need somebody)
I need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love

JB, UR yeah man
<div class="lyricbox">[Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You tryin’ forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let’s get right
Now that I’m here baby...

[Hook]
Show me a good time
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

Show me a good
Show me a good time
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Drake - Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
With the people that I won’t forget
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
For the things that I won’t regret

I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
Tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
That’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now

This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
Go to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
If you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now

[Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
It's been one of those days
You tryin’ forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let’s get right
Now that I’m here baby...

[Hook]
Show me a good time
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

Show me a good
Show me a good time
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Drake - Verse 2]
How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money, Young Money, pop champagne

Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
And start livin’ that life dawg

Feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature
Ahh, young and rich and out of control

Out in L.A. blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
So imma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
Call me overrated or creative or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup</div>
I wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works
Yelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words
I take my face off at the door 'cause I don't know who they will take me for
I wonder if I tell them what I did last night
Whether or not I got caught, they just might
Wage war on you, therefore it's true
That I shot my general on my side of enemy lines

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I'm not trying to be lying to you
But it takes a clever guy to do what I do
It takes some chivalry and well placed energy
To subliminally get yourself inside you
Introspection is the name of this session
Spread this infection, reflect it on the next one
The next one, the next one, and when we're done
We'll all have made something new under the sun
I'm not done, I'm not done yet, no
Kick me off the stage and take my microphone
Then you'll walk up to me and when you get close
I'll look you in the face and say, "Where's your home?
Where are you going and why are you here?"
Have you asked these questions? Have you been sincere?
Want to know what I believe, it's right here
Dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I will tell you what I can
But your mind will take a stand
I sing of a greater love
Let me know when you've had enough

I will tell you what I can
But your mind will take a stand
I sing of a greater love
Let me know when you've had enough

I will tell you what I can
But your mind will take a stand
I sing of a greater love
Let me know when you've had enough
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true
You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

I know someone out there knows what I'm saying (oh no)
Maybe you're a girl who's wishing just like me (yeah, yeah)
There is one in you, know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holidays and hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true
You're the single line up on my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

In the morning I know everybody's rushing
To see what's underneath their Christmas tree
Know what I mean 'cause I won't find it there
Underneath the mistletoe is where
You make my holidays, so hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true (everything I've wished for, yeah yeah)
You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

Me there, me there, yeah
Only you can make this a Merry Merry Christmas

There is one and you know who you are all I have to give is my heart
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say

If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I've wished for has come true
You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
Mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, meet me there

All I ever wanted was you, this Christmas
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I need you baby

You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where, I'll be waiting, kiss me there

I'll be waiting, kiss me there
[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Hook]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Hook]
[Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica]
Now I let you out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive

Keep on survivin'

Thought I couldn't breathe without you
I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you
But I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here
Even in my years to come
I'm still gon be here

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it

I'm wishin' you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon blast you on the radio
I'm not gon lie on you and your family, yo
I'm not gon hate on you in the magazines
('m better than that)
I'm not gon compromise my Christianity
(I'm better than that)
You know I'm not gon dis you on the internet
Cause my mama taught me better than that

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gonna work harder
I'm a survivor

Keep on survivin'

(Beyonce and Michelle)
Oh (oh) oh (oh)...
After of all of the darkness and sadness
Soon comes happiness
If I surround my self with positive things
I'll gain prosperity

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
I'm in this fight, and I'm swinging
And my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I tried to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

Chorus:
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared of the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
In this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you, I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness
I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)
What just happened?
Did you kiss me?
'Cuz that's a place we've never been
Until now
And I dunno
How we're gunna be after this
Do we pretend these feelings don't exist at all?
Or do we fall?

My confusion shows
Whenever you
Stand so close
I stumble
I stutter
Forget what to say
I'm nervous
I wonder why I'm acting this way

(Chorus)
It's temporary insanity
What going on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
Woh-oh-oh (x2)

You made a move
Don't change your mind
Too much to lose
We've crossed the line
Between friends and something more
Was it all a big mistake?
'Cuz if it was it's much too late to undo
And I don't really want to

Let you go
But I still don't know
How I feel about you
What this really means
It's crazy to want you
Is it meant to be?

Its temporary insanity
What's goin' on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?(x2)
Woh-oh-oh(x2)

Hey what you do to me
What's come over me?
If this is crazy
There's nothing I'd rather be
Than here with you now
Let's figure this out

Here with you now(x2)
Its temporary insanity
What goin' on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?(x2)

(Losin' my mind)(x2)
(What's goin' on?)
(Losin my mind)(x3)

Insanity
What you do to me
(Chorus:)
Something bout the way that you workin me,
teasin me, pleasing me, easily boy, I'm addicted to you
Got a have ya for all the things that u do
It something bout this feeling, it's crazy,
amazing that stays with me all night and day,
Makes my temperature rise
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like i'm captured by the touch of your hand
Its so vibe it's your style it the way the that u smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, its electric, this felling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried ??

(Chorus:)
You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin' but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast i'm a afraid can't escape there's no way
Never had a feeling like this b4

(Chorus:)
It's amazing how u drive me crazy
Boy keep doin' what you're doin'
Cause you're really gettin through to me

Just one look into my eyes and u know u got me hypnotized

We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids,
Culture forbids,
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is,
To fall off the grid.

We live for the night's decor,
It reveals what we dream of.

I know there's someone at the door,
They called for help, of this I'm sure,
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great,
I know some people who know people who are flying straight,
But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression,
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again.

We live for the night's decor,
It reveals what we dream of.

I know there's someone at the door,
They called for help, of this I'm sure,
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

This room is far too dark for us to stay around,
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down.
Make them stop.

I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.
Make them stop.
Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type
But I can make you sway

It makes you burn to learn
You're not the only one
I'd let you be if you
Put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell
Where you end and I begin

It makes me burn to learn
You're with another man
I wonder if he's half
The lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
<div class="lyricbox">I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost 
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me 
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out 
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog 
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb 
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard 
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire 
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows 
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean rosé?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man</div>
(feat. Trey Songz)

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

[Drake:]
Nah,
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars
I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
That's my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies,
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a misses

[Trey Songz:]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house
Do you got somebody new in your life
Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Hook:]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop

[Trey Songz:]
Missin everything you say,
Missin all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this with out you here
Baby 07' supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Hook:]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

[Bridge:]
Wish I, Could wake up and forget about you
Not tryin to call you when I know I want to
(O wish I,) I gotta fight this feeling can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were apart of me

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Oooo No) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

[Chorus:]
I can't stop, missing you
(I don't wanna stop) I can't stop missing you
(Baby) I can't stop missing you,
No, No, No, No
I can't stop, Missin you
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
<div class="lyricbox">It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

The wait is ova


I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you’re
Feeling brave
There’s so much power

In my name
If you pop off in your seat
Steady
I’m gonna do the wave

I’m such a
Fucking lady
You don’t have to be
So afraid

'Cause I got room
Up on my team
You can play
But hold up

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

It’s getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova

Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don’t you fumble
That’s a flag on the play
Babe if you don’t wanna
Then you don’t have to wait
But together
We gon’ be taking over

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

So you don’t wanna wait
I hate to hear
That’s such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways
Ain't no time out in my game
They already underway

I know you want to win
And you wish
I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play
But hold up

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

It’s getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova

Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don’t you fumble
That’s a flag on the play
Babe if you don’t wanna
Then you don’t have to wait
But together
We gon’ be taking over

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

Baby put the work in
Like a champion
But the crowd is screaming
With their hands way up
Couldn’t be with no one else
You’re the only way
I win

Baby got the whole world
Standing up
Damn I’m glad I picked ya
Took a chance on love
Baby love

The time is now
And now
The wait is ova

(Just wait your turn)

The wait is ova
(Just wait your turn)

It’s getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova

Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don’t you fumble
That’s a flag on the play
Babe if you don’t wanna
Then you don’t have to wait
But together
We gon’ be taking over

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

Just wait your turn
The wait is ova
The wait is ova</div>
