Justin Bieber
I just can't wait

Mariah Carey
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

Mariah Carey
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You, baby

Justin Bieber
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
(You baby)

Mariah Carey &amp; Justin Bieber
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Yeah

Mariah Carey
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own

Justin Bieber
For my own
Baby

Mariah Carey
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

Mariah Carey &amp; Justin Bieber

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?

In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
You see my baby over here
Hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
What you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

See my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I (oh I) I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah)

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Justin Bieber
Never say never
(never, ever)

Yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never

Ne-never say never (never)

I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh

And there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (never say never) I will fight
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!)
I got ya little bro
I can handle him
Hold up
I, I can handle him

Jaden Smith
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never (never say it, never say it)
Say never (okay, okay)

Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
never, never, say never
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never
The Band Perry
Looking out the window
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight

Justin Bieber
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
The Band Perry
You should be here with me safe and warm

The Band Perry and Justin Bieber
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Justin Bieber
Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
Except for the clock on the wall yeah yeah

The Band Perry and Justin Bieber
I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe

When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I
Till Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
Oh oh oh oh
I'll be waiting

Waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight
<div class="lyricbox">Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call), if I got you today
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause girl I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know

Don't tell me your my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking

Girl you see me here standing here
Standing in the rain
Any chance that you could stay right here
And never go away

You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause girl I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet later on the low

Don't tell me your my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking

So what I’m really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn’t been easy for us to talk with everyone being around
But this is, this is personal, this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I know the seasons may change
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I'm under this umbrella and I’m calling your name
And you know I don’t wanna lose that

I still believe in us
I still believe in love
I hope you believe in love
The way I believe in us

You don’t see, 'cause what you don’t see, is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands I’d give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I’m feelin’
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I, the way that I

You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
Be careful with your heart</div>

Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me

<div class="lyricbox">Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
When you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I stay by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that’s for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh lord

Where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
When you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I stay by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn’t open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith
Turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping

Tell me he, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn’t find you anywhere

Where you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I was by your side

So where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most</div>
Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all responsibility
I'd go out of my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same

Maybe you could change me

Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing
Be like Serenity
Help me position my mind
Take a chance
Make a difference in my life

Maybe you could change me

Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
<div class="lyricbox">Happy birthday. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it. 
Believing in what she say'll have you livid. 
Know they won't be happy 'til our love is over. 
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it. 

They ain’t ever had trust like how we got it. 
They ain't never had a chance how you got it. 
So they can't help but to come and hate on it. 
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 

It's like you're always looking for a problem. 
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em. 
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'. 
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em. 

They ain’t ever had trust like how we got it. 
They ain't never had a chance how you got it. 
So they can't help but to come and hate on it. 
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 

She texts me "How's you love life?" and "How are you?", I said "I'm good". 
They only get as close as you allow them to. 
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather. 
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever. 
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer. 
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me. 
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place. 
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home. 
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42. 
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you. 
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape. 
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight. 
Esco. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are.</div>
There's a dream in my soul
A fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
Waiting to be set free

I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it
I can taste it
Change is coming my way

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around (whoa)
This world can make you feel small (whoa)
They will not keep me down (whoa)
I was born to stand tall

I'm goin' all the way
I can feel it, I believe it
I'm here, I'm here to stay

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me

I'll light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Feel it
Believe it
Dream it
Be it

I was born to be somebody (born to be)
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me (no, no, no)
I'll light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Whoa oh

And this world will belong to me
Yeah, yeah, oh
This world will belong to me

Nights like this don't happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me? or did I lose control?

Lonely overseas
Lonely memories

People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a world baby
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It's been difficult
I’m just happy there's no fights no more
But it’s nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason why this happens for

There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl

Il y a des mots qu'aujourd'hui on se dit
Mais qui nous font du tord
Et qui ne valent rien quand on les retient
Et ça rien que pour y croire encore
Tu gardes les mots qui restent intacts
Et les larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi
There'll be the one less lonely girl

Ohh (oh oh)
Aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
(No no)
C'est avec toi que je veux être plus que tout
And when you're mine in the world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Je me tiens devant toi
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas
(That's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Mais ça n'est qu'un souvenir dans ta vie
Il y a trop d'espace entre vous
Même les heures passées à toujours penser
Ne servent à rien après tout
Et tellement de mots perdus sur des pages
Et des larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi
There'll be the one less lonely girl

Ohh (oh oh)
Aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

C'est avec toi que je veux être plus que tout
And when you're mine in this world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Je me tiens devant toi
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas
(That's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Il faut seulement que tu t'en sortes
Il faut que tu passes la porte pour que je te délivre
Tu n'as seulement qu'à le dire plus fort
(Free to fall)
Un peu plus fort
(Fall in love)
Je prie pour qu'aujourd'hui tu commences ta vie
Avec moi je promets
You'll be one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Adore ya girl I want ya

You're used to going out your way
To impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
Is a dream that can't be real
So girl let's write a fairytale
And show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of (of)
Girl you ain't my runner up (up)
And no matter what you're always number one

Oh oh oh
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

You overstand, I’m incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo’d up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that

Be patient

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t want to be left with the questions, why
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
'Cause we’re strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we got to learn to trust right now

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That’s what we ought to do
Yeah

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
'Cause we’re strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Trust me right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, we gotta learn to trust right now
Girl you gotta learn to trust me right now
Hey, hey, yeah
If I believe in love and you believe in love

We gotta learn to trust

From a thousand miles away
When you smile, I smile oh

You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Oh oh, for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, 'cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
'Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And you shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm 16 and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone
So far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong
We were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favorite song
She was wrong
I am gone
I thought I loved her
Never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover
But now until another like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Justin Bieber
Never say never
(never, never, never)

Yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never

Ne-never say never

I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (never say never) I will fight
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!)
I got ya little bro
I can handle him
Hold up
I, I can handle him

Jaden Smith
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never
I will never say never
(never say it, never say it)
Say never
I will fight till forever
(okay, okay)
To make it right

Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
And never say never
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never
She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for
And she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
She can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this live
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Why can I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see, how good this can be
I hope she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side
Cause she gets the light that is in me
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like puttin' fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried 'bout
Ooh you know females
And how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood (don't change your mood)

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, sometimes be your best friend
Perfect - ain't saying that I am
Proven, least I'm provin' that I give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I outta be to you, to you
Envy, envy
Same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad
(I ain't all bad)
Jessica Jarrell

So back and forth that's how it seems, oh

So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver

Life saver, oh life saver
My life saver
Whoa

Never understood you when you'd say (whoa)
You wanted me to meet you halfway (whoa)

Got me out here in the water and I

Lately I've been thinkin',
Thinkin' bout what we had,
And I know it's hard,
it was all that we knew

Have you been drinkin'?
To take all the pain away,
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

'Cuz nothing can ever
Ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You'd know there's no one
I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storms
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together, mm

I gave you everything baby
Everything I had to give
Girl why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion
Like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
But that is the past now
We didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be

Tell me, was it worth it?
We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storms
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together, mm

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storms
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together, oh
Believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Believe...

There were days when out you spoken, you know
There were night when I was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from falling
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

Where would I be, if you, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel
Touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel
Touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe

Where would I be, if you didn't believe

You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

The tooth under your pillow case
No I won't I won't
Ever have let you down? (no)
like a see saw let's you down (oh)
You know why
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby

We're big enough
To stand in the picture
To stand next to love

I was a player
When I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker
When I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger
Love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoaa

Remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed close
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby

We're big enough
To stand in the picture
To stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoaa

Remember those stroll down street?
(I remember that)
Don't knock you earrings, like yesterday
They shine on me
We were little then
In class daydreamed about you ooooohhohh
Just remember you ooooohhohh

Since then all I can remember is the love
Falling down

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger

Whoaa
We were inseparable (inseparable)
Everything I had to do I did it next to you (next to you)
And the memories we made are so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
'Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
Then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

You got used to being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to being alone, all alone
Oooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happenin'
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could've divided my time
I should've fractioned it
But

There was nothing that I could do ooh
'Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
Then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

You got used to being alone (alone), alone (all alone)
You adapted (you adapted) now you're used to (forgive me for you)
being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
Oooh you got used to being (used to) on your own
(All on your own)
Oh oh, oh oh
It's JB (JB)

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya
Above ya

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong (belong)
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya
Above ya

Tell me you love me

My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
You said "I come in peace", so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend, please listen to me

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Uh, greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world, I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taken over this planet since I've arrived
I'm in the backpack, I'm ducking Men In Black
Yeah I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gon' name this planet after me
Wayne's world (wayne's world, wayne's world)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted, it's a gift from the mother
In, in your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
Oh, oh oh ohoh
(And I pray)

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Ooh, I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray yeah
I close my eyes and...

I pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls that need a break
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (and I pray)
I close my eyes and I pray (oh)
ohohoh

I pray (oh, and I pray)
I pray

I close my eyes and pray

Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)

Justin Bieber
When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Usher
It's your chance, take her hand
To the floor, to the floor
Girl if you see some and you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance
For your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man

Justin Bieber
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment

Oh, oh oh ohoh

I pull up and then I hop out, like what's hatnin'
I knock on the door, she know who it is, what's hatnin'
We on a roll, we 'bout to go, what's hatnin'
We took off in that UFO, like what's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, whatever happens, it's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, you got it girl, what's hatnin'

But I don't wanna fight babe

Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me and we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me, baby we can solve it

Raekwon
Visual visual JB
Yo Ye whattup
Raekwon

You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta

Justin Bieber
You see my baby over here
Hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
What you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Kanye West
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine

Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I (oh I) I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah)

Raekwon
Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this b*tch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh baby
I know it's hard but
Let's go

There's something different in your eyes baby
You can't seem to look into mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gonna assume that something's wrong

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely trippin' I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me you're just like them
You're just like them

I know that it's hard to trust of
But you need the trust that my love
Will never leave you in the dust

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely trippin' I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me you're just like them
You're just like them

Baby you ain't get this love on track
Will you run away gotta wait on after love back
You know that I love you girl so tell me what you're waiting for
You gotta know know know know
Know know know know know know

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely trippin' I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me you're just like them
You're just like them

So just forget about the world, be young tonight

Justin Bieber, you know imma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep my eye out for Selena
Beauty, beauty and the beast

Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go)

Justin Bieber:
Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all about you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
'Cause...
Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright
What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
I wanna know
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh baby, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my heart into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter what, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.
That's what it's....that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is.
No I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
'Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable

Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone (oh no)
Didn't waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
'Cause I was out of line (oh, yeah)

But I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl

It was a bad day (hey, yeah, yeah)
I know I was wrong
But you could have said "goodbye" baby
It was a bad day
Now I'm like, "wow"

It was a bad day
<div class="lyricbox">If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah.
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh.

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would
I would build the love of river wide,
So that it never runs dry, yeah
Anytime you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry⬧
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind, no.

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would
Yeah, it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need.
I know that he hurt you,
But that wasn't me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That all we need to be

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day, no,
Baby, I would, baby, I would,

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would.</div>

Alright well

I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
The one I wake up thinking about
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you till the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect

I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
I'm the one you wake up thinkin' 'bout
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you till the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect
Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
<div class="lyricbox">First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Missin' ya good intentions
Missin' ya from a distance
Hope ya did the same
I know that I caused a problem
I know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Sayin nothing gets you nowhere fast
I’mma hold it back inside

Well now that I'm back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Goin' through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothin' in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That’s what they used to say
'Cause goin to sleep alone at night
I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holdin' back this time

Now that I’m back around ya
Nothin around me matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right (make it right, make it right)
It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

You know I’mma do you right (I’mma do you right, I’mma do you right)
You know I’mma do you right (I’mma do you right)
I'mma do you right
You know I’mma do you right (I’mma do you right, I’mma do you right)</div>
Girl I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you love me
We let it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I felt victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl you're in your only
Rather be stuck in the night, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you

Justin Bieber
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Tyga
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than its gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
That I thought
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment

Justin Bieber
Now Romeo &amp; Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie &amp; Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do

You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't
I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam &amp; Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny &amp; Cher
I don't care
I got you baby

See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
(Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
(And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Mmmm

I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world
Yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
Any less than you should
Cause baby
You smile I smile (oh)
Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile (oh whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey

Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
Cause baby (hey)
You smile, I smile (whoa hey)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
I smile, I smile, I smile
Make me smile baby

Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Hey hey hey

You smile, I smile (whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
I smile, I smile, I smile

(Justin, Justin)

So girl let's write a fairytale
And show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of
And girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what, you're always number one

My prize possession
One and only

I close my eyes, I take it slow. 
Lay on down and let me rest my soul. 
I've been so high, I've been so low. 
I'm just tryna find my way back home. 
Can't help but roam. 
My signal's gone. 
Guess this journey's left me on my own. 
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone. 

And if I could. 
Forget about the way you love me. 
Forget about the world, we're set in stone. 
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now. 
If only I could hit the ground 
I never thought that I'd be broken 
I never thought I'd be this far from home. 
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now. 
If only I could hit the ground. 

I close my eyes, I take it slow.

Take it one day at a time. 
Reach for the stars now. 
Ooh just leave the past behind. 
It's a part of living. 

If only I could hit the ground. 
If only I could. 
I could hit the ground, right now. 
If I could hit the ground. 
Then I'd be falling down. 
If only I could hit the ground. 
If I could hit the ground. 
Then I'd be touching down. 
If only I could hit the ground.

You’re imperfectly perfect
Everyone’s itching for beauty
But just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found
Can the DJ please reverse it
In life we pay for change
Let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles
But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

Oh no
Oh no, oh (oh)

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug (last hug, last hug)
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality (reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand
And I understand that it's meant to be
'Cause baby when you're with me

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin', no pain, no fear (no fear, no fear)

So today is all about you baby
The mistletoe can pull us close
That's what I'm waiting for
It sort of feels like it's Valentines, Valentines

Them carols are singing
Japan to Peru

I love you, need you
Need you to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Is this what you want? The baddest, the baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, have to have it, hit it twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed Imma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all about you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
'Cause...
Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank
That's where our hearts once save
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex 'til we got closure
Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it

And now my April shower you, forever and for me
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be a fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side
Keep growing closer throughout October
Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's eve
Then we'll be celebrating

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it
Oh, oh whoa
Oh whoa

Where are you now?
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand?
I wanna be close

Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

Where are you now?
Now that I'm half-grown
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone

Where are you now?
When nothing's going right?
I can't see the light

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

I need you
To need me
Can't you see me
How could you leave me
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole
When you're not with me

I want you
Here with me
To guide me
Hold me
And love me now

Where are you now?
Ohh

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be, yeah
I need you to set me free, yeah

Oh-oh
Where are you now? Oh
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh
Yeah
The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what I'm supposed to do

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

In my head we're already together
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Should I tell her, how I really feel
Or should I moving closer just be still
How would I know?
Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same?

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Catching feelings, catching feelings

Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That’s right I think she foreign
Think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon’ work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
And I’m down with it
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It’s not hard to notice, that I’m open
Hypnotized by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
And I’m down with it

You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time

Still I gotta have it
Oh no no, oh no no
But still I gotta have it</div>
Justin Bieber
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Usher
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
Both
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase (oh wooah)
To kids from one to ninety-two (yeah, yeah)
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas (yeah), Merry Christmas (oh no)
Merry Christmas to you
Justin
Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

Yeah, yeah
(I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it)

Rum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the Son
Playin' for the king, playin for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight, I might go psycho
Christmas time so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know I'm still young but I go I go
Stupid stupid love like cupid
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum
Busta Rhymes
Gather round the mistletoe real quick
Justin
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pa pum pum
Busta Rhymes
Matter of fact, let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in here
Justin
That's fit to give our king
Busta Rhymes
Bieber what up
Justin
Pa rum pa pum pum, pa rum pum, pa rum pum

Busta Rhymes
Lemme get straight to it. Yo
At the table with the family, havin' dinner
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
I said, "Cool." Ya know Imma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! "

Justin
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, pa pum pum, pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe

Globe globe globe globe globe
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space, and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
I wanna know
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh baby, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Oh (oh, oh oh)
Oh oh
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for ya
For you I'd be (whoa oh)
Running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are

Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
giving you all this attention
Baby listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody

Every day
I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me (smile for me)
I would take
Every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime

Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Givin' you all this attention
Baby listen
I just need somebody to love
oh no no no no no
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love (oh oh oh)
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love
I, I need somebody
I, I just need somebody to love

And you can have it all,
Anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want
I can't find 'cause
Money can't find me
Somebody to love (oh oh oh)
Find me somebody to love (whoah ohh)

I need somebody to love yeah
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl I swear
I just need somebody to love

I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, gonna need somebody
I need somebody, (I, I need somebody)
I need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love
Feeling the remnants, got it in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you
Oh oh
Oh ohhh

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight
Through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears? Oh whoa
So far away and now I just need you here

So we'll fight
Through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh

We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
To get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
Justin Bieber
Oh whoa

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Ludacris
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Justin Bieber
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
I'm gone
Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Alright let's go
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh, oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you

If you let me inside of your world

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh, oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in this world

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe yeah
I just wanna set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely

There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl

<div class="lyricbox">My life is a movie
And everyone’s watching
So let’s get to the good part
And passed all the non-sense

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I'll show you

I’ve got to learn things
Learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I'll show you

'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I’ll show you</div>

Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance

Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink

This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops

She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm
It's getting harder to shield
This pain is my heart
Ooh ooh

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me (no)

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh (oh baby oh)
Giving you flowers
Talking for hours
I never should've let you go
That should be me (that should be me)
Oh baby
That should be me
Mafia

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live (then we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears?
So far away and now I just need you here

So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live (and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road (there's no road)
To get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle 
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Oh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go

Don’t let this go to your head
But you’re the best, I’ve ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance

Something like a zip-loc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh, so hard walking out
You got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, no
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, no

Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don’t know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Oh, when you got me in a gridlock
What a great spot
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won’t stop no
So hard walking out
You got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, oh baby

Holdin' back the faces I would make
I’m a fan and you’re the rock star
Makin' it hard on me
Visualize a monster
'Cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow, I’m hit
Need you right near me
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away (no no)
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight ooh
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go</div>
Justin Bieber
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Tyga
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than its gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
That I thought
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment

Justin Bieber
Now Romeo &amp; Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie &amp; Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do

You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't
I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam &amp; Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny &amp; Cher
I don't care
I got you baby

See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
(Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
(And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah

You're the single line upon my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish

Lately you've been busy
Wonderin' if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different?
Talk to me—I'll listen
All the love I'm givin', don't act like you don't know

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time (bad time)
When I know you probably think it's a lie (a lie)
And I know I told you last time was the last time (last time)
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline (flatline)?
Flatline (flatline), flatline (flatline)
When I hit you, you don't even reply (reply)
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline?

Not breathin', what is it that I'm not seein'
Said she's leavin', damn I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleedin'
Knowin' that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what Imma do now

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, oh

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

Before your love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here (here, here, yeahhh)

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?  (do you understand?)
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

I can't imagine life without your touch,
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'

I'm gonna hold it down for you
You, whoa, oh, whoa
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah whoa

I don't wanna to go back
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again
Justin Bieber
As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me

Big Sean
Yo, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it, I'll fly you to it
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me
As long as you lo-lo-lo.. (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love me (that's all I want baby)
As long as you love, love, love, love me (please don't go)
As long as you love me

<div class="lyricbox">You ain't gotta answer none of my calls. 
I'm believing you'll pick up one day. 
I don't wanna add to your pain at all. 
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life. 
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life. 
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else. 
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself. 
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure. 

Thought that you were in it for the paper. 
Never thought I'd take you serious. 
Now I need you, not a moment later. 
Losin' it, I'm so delirious. 
And I'ma put up a fight for it. 
Never give up a love like this. 
Finally I found someone. 
That can do me like no other. 
Talking to my conscience. 
I made a few mistakes. 
I did it to myself. 
I'm the only one to blame. 
I know you need a little while to believe again. 
To love again. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll be waiting for you. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll still. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 

Put my key in the ignition. 
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me. 
I know that you ain’t got no plans to leave. 
Girl I need your attention. 
And every time I see you make that face. 
I wanna love you all over the place. 
Don't do it, baby. 
Don't do it to me, no. 

I know you don't wanna talk, right. 
We've been on and off like the crosslights. 
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right? 
When I touch you, I get frostbite. 
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold. 
How we so young but livin' so old? 
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo. 
That could drive you loco. 
You supposed to me my uno, Yoko Ono. 
Oh no, round two again. 
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken 
Last time we argued eight straight days. 
I learned my lesson, I got straight As. 
And I know it's deeper than masseuses. 
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious 
Go ahead and take the time. 
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine. 
Think about it. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll be waiting for you. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll still. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I know I did you wrong. 
Let your heart heal. 
Don't rush, no pressure.</div>

One of the nights I'll run right now

If you wanna ride with me
And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off, no problem
You can go your way, and I'll go mine

Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, whoa
Whoa oh
I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell
No, no, no
That's not me
Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too,
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright

<div class="lyricbox">It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

Word on the street's Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer flying thru the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Hey love, the wise men followed a star
The wise men followed a star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Aye love, don't you buy me nothing
Don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a Merry Merry Christmas

It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you

One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you

Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you

Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take you and leave the world with one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world

One less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
<div class="lyricbox">Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
You’d be a billionaire in a year
That’s what you gotta think ‘till you’re there, on the record line

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don’t condone it, love is a component
You’re the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Baby, I had a good time, and yes I pop strings
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don’t condone it, love is a component
You’re the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

She growing up aight
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I, I just didn’t think I wasn’t good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I’d get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that
I wasn’t going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren’t perfect
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it’s like he’s perfect and he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition</div>
Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world, where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shiney moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all are dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
Let's go
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
I'ma tell you one time
One time

When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we goin' keep keep climbin' to the mountain top

Your world is my world

And my breath is your breath

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call the referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances

Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Yeah, I know that I let you down

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
