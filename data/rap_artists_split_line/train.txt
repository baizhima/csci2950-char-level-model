she like, "fuck it, i'll just stay down here and do <unk>
'cause that's enough money to buy her a few <unk> of new airs
'cause her <unk> don't really care
she's so precious with the peer pressure
couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter <unk>
she had hair so long that it looked like weave

it was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an <unk>

cut the fucking act like you're happy i'm fucking back again
with another <unk> why stop when it doesn't have to <unk>
it ain't over till i say it's over, enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up

i'm afraid of <unk> happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown into an <unk> <unk> i <unk> it
raise your hands up like it's twelve <unk> nah, homie
hold them bitches <unk> up, wave 'em till you <unk> a <unk> cuff

came up <unk> came to <unk> <unk> nah, <unk>
i ain't <unk> enough, last chance to make this whole <unk> <unk>

this is survival of the <unk>
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the <unk> maybe i can just <unk> enough
to fill up this last can, man will i survive in this <unk> or what?
they said i was washed up, and got a blood bath
i'm not a rapper, i'm an <unk> i can <unk>
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so <unk> open if you'd like to discuss

top 5 in this mothafucka and if i don't make the cut
what, like i give a fuck, i will light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
into the side of a pump, zero to 60 hop in and gun it
like g-unit without the <unk> i'm <unk> 'em up

and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a <unk>
and i look like i might just give up, eh you <unk> <unk>
me for <unk> out, i ain't taking a <unk> i'm <unk> myself
with a fucking knife in the <unk> while i'm <unk> my butt

'cause i just <unk> on the mic, and i like getting cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'cause i'mma fight till i die or win
<unk> the dust it'll just make me <unk> wait

let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me <unk>
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
it's survival of what?

this is survival of the <unk>
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

so get your <unk> stack your ammo

verse <unk>
i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
<unk> at <unk> and swinging at the <unk>
inside the <unk> of his basement

sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of <unk> i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me <unk> so many babies screaming
cause they seeing <unk> before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all <unk> and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen the change <unk>
i keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
<unk> in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open now, can only say i'll try
until the day i die, i promise to be wise
with my heart open free, brings only misery
a way to <unk> so i stay sucker free
only a few <unk> rise <unk>
my ghetto <unk> rise <unk>
don't be afraid to try <unk>
too many of us died to the door to open wide
my brother be <unk> stay focused on the <unk>
though everybody dies
we <unk>

(eminem)
only learn to take, our anger and our hate
control our mental <unk> settle down, and just set it straight
maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
for we said it, regret it later, and let it <unk>
cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
theres only so much someone can swallow and <unk>
to the point that he just <unk> <unk> and thats all it takes
you'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
but we aint
its plain to go <unk> with every <unk> comes the image he <unk>
and a picture that he <unk>
but in the <unk> of all this anger and this <unk>
never once did you hear me say i'm a gangster and i aint hear no <unk>
but i know, that i will always continue to <unk>
as long as i lead and never follow no one else's shadow
there will never be another me
and that i can guarantee
thats why the fuck i remain sucker free to this day
the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame or success they <unk>
there will never be another me
and no matter what they do
there will never be another you
you can search but you'll never find
you can try to rewind time
but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die
we are forever alive
and we continue <unk>

<unk>
one day at a time

don't be caught in the <unk> and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money and light
searching for fortune and fame, and super <unk>
all the <unk> all the cars, whose crew is the <unk>
now the hip-hop police, the <unk> is watching
and kids think beef is the only option
<unk> born <unk> guilty as <unk>
my memories of him die, but <unk> lives on
you think the industry is fun
and no pity with guns
and when your money is upmost incredible baby
uhh - mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
yeah, yeah.. uhh

[chorus]
i can't see 'em comin down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry

good dudes - i know you love me like cooked food
even though a nigga got move like a crook move
we was together on the block since free lunch
we shoulda been together havin 4 seasons <unk>
we used to use <unk> to face the bad weather
so now we travel first class to change the <unk>
never in <unk> just me and you
i loved your point of view cause you held no <unk>
still i left you for months on end
it's been months since i <unk> back in
well somewhere in a small town, somewhere <unk> a mall down
<unk> four and change, armor <unk> down
i can understand why you want a <unk> now
though i can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
pretend to be <unk> that's just one to grow with
but deep inside a nigga so sick

[chorus]

the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
we say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
it's lust, 'cause neither one of us <unk> each other so we fuck
till we bust, till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
shout till i throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
we fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize <unk> laughter
pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
there ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do

'cause the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

'cause i hate you, do you hate me?

you're a slut, but i'm equal, i'm a <unk> we're both <unk> our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

we can make <unk> people spread <unk>
but they ain't got proof, till they do, it's just the two of us
you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's <unk> me
but you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be <unk> yeah i would
'cuz the sex is too damn good, if i ran, who would i run to
that would be this soft and <unk> so it's off and on
usually more off then on but at least we know that we
share this common <unk> you're the only one i can fuck
without a condom on, i hope the only reason that i <unk>
is 'cuz of that fact and i can bust in that, and that's why

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

try to pull each other's legs until the other <unk>
we're lying to <unk> that's the beauty of it, yeah
'cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night

and it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this <unk> up rage
we both have, we both feel like we've been <unk>

back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for <unk>
then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he was <unk> doin' <unk> out of your basement
he let us hit the weed on <unk> for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
feel like i never say much but man there's a lot to know
feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
i'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those

lookin' in the mirror i'm closer than i really appear
creepin' like <unk> without the <unk> love, and care
no tender love and care and no love and <unk>
i got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
i might be here as a <unk> to teach people the lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
yeah, but here we are and it's a new <unk>
40 the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
a lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation

you don't be <unk> perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
you platinum like rappers on <unk> boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was <unk>
and then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and did it with a purpose
used to have secret <unk> to <unk> my <unk>

so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?

i'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause i'm only giving you
things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or <unk> it all

i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it <unk> i just shit item, what's goin' on, this is paul <unk> your faithful attorney at <unk>
listen, i listened to the rough copy of your album and uhh, you know i just gotta be honest with you.step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall <unk>

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his <unk>
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter

i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an <unk>
i need to be the <unk> my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever just pop off, i'm supposed to be beside 'em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy, this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit

and even though the battle was won, i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it, <unk> i'm <unk>
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for, it's not why i got in it

that was never my <unk> for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped <unk>
it wasn't my <unk> my intentions was good
i went through my whole career without ever <unk> it

now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
so i did, i just fell back, watched and <unk> my teeth

while he's all over tv down talkin' a man
who literally saved my life, like "fuck it, i <unk>
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's <unk> 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets <unk> it ain't just words no more is it?

it's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

until ja started <unk> in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some <unk> at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an <unk> for me and thinks that i'll be his <unk>
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that <unk> the same one that made me famousand everyone should get along

eminem impersonating mr. mackey &amp; eric cartman :
okay children, quiet down, quiet down
children, i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr. shady
children, quiet down please
<unk> don't throw that (shut up)
mr. shady will be your new substitute while mr. kaniff is out with <unk> (he's got <unk>
good luck mr. shady

hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)
today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob (hi <unk> <unk> 30 and still lives with his mom
he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and <unk> pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for <unk> off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the <unk> block

and even if they <unk> and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
till one night mrs. stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block, uh
you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to <unk> they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (come on)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad <unk> your hand)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
and there's really nothing else to say (sing <unk>
drugs are just bad, m'kay

my penis is the size of a <unk> have you seen it
fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
speaking of <unk> you know what else is bad for squirrels
<unk> it's the worst drug in the world

if someone ever <unk> it to you, don't do it
kids, two <unk> probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is <unk> you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

meet <unk> 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a <unk> party, he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's <unk> by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

<unk> he starts to <unk> and his <unk>
goes into <unk> and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up, looks like the <unk> arches
he's on <unk> <unk> layin' <unk> <unk>

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey <unk> <unk> is a <unk> look at <unk>
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile <unk> in a <unk> the action is over
and his back and his shoulders <unk> up like he's practicing <unk>
and that's the story of <unk> the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (that's right)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs <unk> <unk>
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)

and starts <unk> things
and he just cant see that hes <unk> <unk>
and in his jealousy and envy
it just <unk> him in a <unk>
as he turns on mtv and sees my face
and he dont exist in his world
so he just <unk> and he <unk>
<unk> and spins till he <unk> himself into rage
and its <unk> him slowly
cuz he does not even know me
even though he sees me everywhere he goes
so he just <unk> himself
he has no fortune and wealth
so he <unk> someone else to get his dough
and now hes acting like a bully

but he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad
he has no choice but to scream

nobody couldn't see the shit i felt
knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell

turned around saw <unk> <unk> a heater in his belt

saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground

it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear slim, i wrote but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in <unk> you must <unk> got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

sometimes i <unk> addresses too sloppy when i <unk> 'em
but <unk> fuck it, what's been up? man, how's your <unk>
my girlfriend's pregnant too, i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'mma call her? i'mma name her bonnie

i read about your uncle <unk> too, i'm <unk>
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam

i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with <unk> <unk> that shit was <unk>
anyways, i hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
truly yours, your biggest fan, this is stan

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad, i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for <unk>

that's my little brother man, he's only six years old
we waited in the <unk> cold for you, four hours and you just said, <unk>
that's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' <unk>
he wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than i do

i ain't that mad though, i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in <unk> you said if i'd write you
you would write back, see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day, i <unk> away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm <unk>
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like <unk> the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real, and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you <unk>

but she don't know you like i know you slim, <unk> does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man, i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
<unk> yours, stan
<unk> we should be together, too

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

now it's too late, i'm on a thousand <unk> now, i'm <unk>

and all i wanted was a <unk> letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it

<unk> to the <unk> <unk> i'm a <unk> ass

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change

it's the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
<unk> been good to me so <unk>

it's so scary in a house that <unk> no swearing

to see him walking around with his headphones <unk>
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
he's a problem child and what <unk> him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
but if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are <unk> he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

he <unk> his pants, <unk> and a <unk> cap
his <unk> hit him so he <unk> him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go

and i don't ever <unk> pausethe more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
we say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
it's lust, 'cause neither one of us <unk> each other so we fuck
till we bust, till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
shout till i throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
we fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize <unk> laughter
pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
there ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do

'cause the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

'cause i hate you, do you hate me?
good, 'cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you

you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut, but i'm equal, i'm a <unk> we're both <unk> our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

we can make <unk> people spread <unk>
but they ain't got proof, till they do, it's just the two of us
you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's <unk> me
but you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be <unk> yeah i would
'cuz the sex is too damn good, if i ran, who would i run to
that would be this soft and <unk> so it's off and on
usually more off then on but at least we know that we
share this common <unk> you're the only one i can fuck
without a condom on, i hope the only reason that i <unk>
is 'cuz of that fact and i can bust in that, and that's why

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

i can never understand it, that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why must we try
is it really so rough that we must always call each other's billy <unk> <unk>

try to pull each other's legs until the other <unk>
we're lying to <unk> that's the beauty of it, yeah
'cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night

and it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this <unk> up rage
we both have, we both feel like we've been <unk>
by someone <unk> we both been someone else's someone else
the problem is neither one wants help
eminem
if there's any bitches in this room, then there's something i gotta say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
i've been down that road and now i'm back, sittin' on square one
tryna pick myself up where i started from

obie trice
i never woulda thought that i'd see you outta control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like <unk> to soul
nothing could <unk> us, especially no hoes

you was more or so the <unk> type, i chose
to more <unk> <unk> you nights i suppose
that's how it go, with time <unk> emotion grows
in the beginning, friends we decided to roll

so who's responsible when you get <unk> explode
and <unk> <unk> then you invite that <unk> cold
but bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
we <unk> this way before we became <unk>

so whats <unk> is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

eminem
i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as <unk> you to my daughters
till you went as far as goin' and <unk> through my drawers

now i just feel stupid for the <unk> that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls

if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked i <unk> to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a <unk> it struck me as <unk> but it turned me on

you started getting <unk> on me, pretty soon we'd argue
and the <unk> you got, the more beautiful you got to me
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought <unk>
<unk> could shoot another one of them goddamn <unk> at me

it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
but see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
till you pull up and see some other <unk> car parked and reach

up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life <unk>
and just as you <unk> and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words <unk> almost <unk> that <unk> ring

spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right, 'cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

<unk> <unk>
yeah right, bitch. spend some time on my <unk>

in most <unk> <unk> attitude is <unk>
my only <unk> is to get head and fuck a bitch
but you was different, thought we <unk> a <unk>
even held your hand in publicsomebody's pulling me closer to the ground

all the happy people, who have real nice lives, and have no idea whats it like, to be broke as <unk>

i feel like i'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
poppin' <unk> i'm a nervous wreck
i deserve respect, but i work a sweat for this worthless check
'bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

minimum <unk> got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and <unk> especially when i'm <unk>
and my <unk> down to her last <unk> it's got my ass <unk>
i pray that god <unk> maybe i'll ask nicer

watchin' ballers while they flossin' in their <unk>
these <unk> stars, becoming autograph <unk>
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the <unk> and average <unk>

'cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money will <unk> you and leave your ass <unk>
snakes <unk> in the grass <unk>

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill

when all you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury <unk> comfortable and <unk> in a six
but they threw me in the mix with all these <unk> <unk>

who walk around <unk> and smoke a pound of <unk> a day
and yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball, but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

kanye west:
so this a&amp;r over at roc-a-fella, named hip hop picked the <unk> beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me, you know, like i always do
i play the <unk> he's like "who that <unk> i'm like "it's <unk> he's like "oh, well <unk>
uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
just askin' me to send him beats, and i'm thinking he's trying to get into <unk> <unk> 'cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin' with
and um, he was friends with my <unk> no id
and no id told him, "look man, you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he <unk>
(yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he <unk>
i was all, i dunno if he was <unk> me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
(i'll sign you as a producer and a <unk>
i'm like "oh shit"
i was messin' with, uh, <unk> also
people were like this, started talking about the ghost <unk> but that's how i got in the game
if it wasn't for that, i wouldn't be here
so you know, after they picked that truth beat i was <unk> i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that
i was stayin' in chicago, i had my own <unk> i be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and <unk> get a pelle pelle off <unk> get some <unk> or something or get a <unk> that's what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i <unk> up this <unk> <unk> sample
i played it for hip over the phone, he's like, "oh, yo that shit is crazy, jay might want it for this <unk> album he <unk> called the <unk>
and at that time, like the drums really weren't <unk> right to me
so i went and um, i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just, like bit the drums off <unk> and put it like with it <unk> up, <unk>
and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it <unk> when he <unk> on "this can't be life"
and that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the <unk> of the soul sound and you know, i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other <unk>
i really wanted to roll with hip hop 'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what i'm sayin' 'cause i been there for a while i <unk> what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day, i came and i <unk> the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said, "oh you a real <unk> <unk>
(oh you a real <unk> dude, man)
and <unk> uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take
and he said, "tell me what you think of <unk>
(check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here)
and i heard it, and i was thinking like, <unk> i really wanted more like of the simple type <unk>
i ain't want like the, the more <unk> complicated <unk> or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me, "what you think of <unk>
(so what you think of this?)
and i was like, <unk> that shit <unk>
you know what i'm <unk> man what i'mma tell him?
i was on the <unk> man, you know
so after that i went back home and man i'm, i'm just in chicago, i'm trying to do my thing
you know, i got <unk> i got acts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like, poppin' off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my <unk> he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my <unk> company, but he ended up going straight with the company
so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company
and i got <unk> at the same time
so i went down and <unk> the beats from him
i took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a <unk> maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out
so i ain't have to deal with the <unk> 'cause he's a jerk
me and my mother drove to <unk> new jersey
(come on, let's just go)
i <unk> even seen my apartment
i remember i pulled up, i <unk> all my shit
<unk> baby, we're here)
you know, we went to <unk> i bought a bed, i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my <unk> and the first beat i made was, uh, <unk> of the <unk>
and beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came up there to <unk> it was <unk> birthday, matter of fact, and i played like seven beats
and, you know i guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he <unk> i had did <unk> like it" already at that time
but then jay walked in, i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like, like it was yesterday
and hip hop said, "yo play that one beat for <unk>
so i played <unk> of the <unk> and really i made <unk> of the <unk> i really wanted to give that beat to <unk>
(no i think jay gon' like this one right here)
and i played another beat, and i played another beat and i remember that gucci <unk> he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, <unk>
two days later, i'm in <unk> and i seen dame
dame didn't know who i was and i was like, <unk> what's up i'm <unk>
(yo, you that kid, <unk>
"you that kid that gave all them beats to <unk> yo, this nigga got <unk> to beats <unk>

then connects you as the prime <unk>
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'cause i got a daughter to feed
and <unk> ain't enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave <unk> bell an' hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the mac
<unk> and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried to escape in the jack
grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
then i <unk> her on her back 'til her <unk> broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin' <unk>
but i'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
and a bunch of other felonies from a to z like <unk> bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots, they bust back
hit me square in the chest, i wasn't wearin' a <unk>

i guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millionsand everyone should get along

eminem impersonating mr. mackey &amp; eric cartman :
okay children, quiet down, quiet down
children, i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr. shady
children, quiet down please
<unk> don't throw that (shut up)
mr. shady will be your new substitute while mr. kaniff is out with <unk> (he's got <unk>
good luck mr. shady

hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)
today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob (hi <unk> <unk> 30 and still lives with his mom
he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and <unk> pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for <unk> off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the <unk> block

and even if they <unk> and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
till one night mrs. stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block, uh
you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to <unk> they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (come on)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad <unk> your hand)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
and there's really nothing else to say (sing <unk>
drugs are just bad, m'kay

my penis is the size of a <unk> have you seen it
fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
speaking of <unk> you know what else is bad for squirrels
<unk> it's the worst drug in the world

if someone ever <unk> it to you, don't do it
kids, two <unk> probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is <unk> you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

meet <unk> 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a <unk> party, he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's <unk> by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

<unk> he starts to <unk> and his <unk>
goes into <unk> and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up, looks like the <unk> arches
he's on <unk> <unk> layin' <unk> <unk>

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey <unk> <unk> is a <unk> look at <unk>
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile <unk> in a <unk> the action is over
and his back and his shoulders <unk> up like he's practicing <unk>
and that's the story of <unk> the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (that's right)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs <unk> <unk>
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)

'cause i'm <unk>
yeah, i'm <unk> (haha)
i got my baby back.
yo, check it out.

some days i <unk> starin' out the window
watchin' this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothin' to live for
i almost break down and cry

sometimes i think i'm crazy, i'm crazy oh so crazy
why am i here, am i just <unk> my time?
but then i see my baby, suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

'cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's <unk> on me
'cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me

my baby girl, keeps gettin' older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make <unk> 'cause they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side

i act like shit don't phase me, inside it <unk> me crazy
my <unk> could eat me alive
but then i see my baby, suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

'cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's <unk> on me
'cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me

man if i could sing i'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
if i could hit the <unk> i'd blow somethin' as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got her
god i'm a daddy, i'm so glad that her mom didn't want her

now you probably get this picture from my public <unk>
that i'm a <unk> drug addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be <unk> honest
'cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul

and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this <unk> on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world, and i think my neck is breakin'
should i just give up or try to live up to these <unk>

now look, i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's <unk> to make my life livin' hell
but i handle it well, given the <unk> i'm dealt
so many <unk> man it's too bad, coulda had someone else

but the years that i've wasted is nothin' to the tears that i've <unk>chorus: x2

we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have gotten so bad between us i don't see us ever being together
ever again like we used to be when we was <unk>
but then of course everything always happens for a reason

i guess it was never meant to be

but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

it's funny, i remember back one year, when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying

'cause daddy felt like a <unk> see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom

was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
on the <unk> in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on <unk>
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre and flew you and mama out to see me

okay,and everyone should get along

eminem impersonating mr. mackey &amp; eric cartman :
okay children, quiet down, quiet down
children, i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr. shady
children, quiet down please
<unk> don't throw that (shut up)
mr. shady will be your new substitute while mr. kaniff is out with <unk> (he's got <unk>
good luck mr. shady

hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)
today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob (hi <unk> <unk> 30 and still lives with his mom
he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and <unk> pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for <unk> off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the <unk> block

and even if they <unk> and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
till one night mrs. stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block, uh
you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to <unk> they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (come on)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad <unk> your hand)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
and there's really nothing else to say (sing <unk>
drugs are just bad, m'kay

my penis is the size of a <unk> have you seen it
fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
speaking of <unk> you know what else is bad for squirrels
<unk> it's the worst drug in the world

if someone ever <unk> it to you, don't do it
kids, two <unk> probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is <unk> you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

meet <unk> 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a <unk> party, he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's <unk> by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

<unk> he starts to <unk> and his <unk>
goes into <unk> and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up, looks like the <unk> arches
he's on <unk> <unk> layin' <unk> <unk>

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey <unk> <unk> is a <unk> look at <unk>
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile <unk> in a <unk> the action is over
and his back and his shoulders <unk> up like he's practicing <unk>
and that's the story of <unk> the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (that's right)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs <unk> <unk>
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
and there's really nothing else to say (uh huh)
drugs are just bad, m'kay

and last but not <unk> one of the most <unk>

from infinite down to the last relapse album, he's still shittin'
whether he's on <unk> paid <unk>
until he <unk> out or he shits his <unk> out of him

<unk> comes first, for better or worse
he's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for christmas
his gift is a <unk> forget the <unk> he's got the <unk>
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole <unk>

i'm not afraid (i'm not <unk> to take a stand (to take a <unk>

fuck your <unk> instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

and to the <unk> i'll never let you down again, i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
let's be honest, that last relapse cd was eh

'cause i ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
and i don't know how, i'm way too up to back down

but i think i'm still tryin' to figure this crap out

i'm <unk> up, i'ma hold my groundthese ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with <unk> hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no <unk>
it's so scary in a house that <unk> no swearing

to see him walking around with his headphones <unk>
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
he's a problem child and what <unk> him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
but if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are <unk> he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

he <unk> his pants, <unk> and a <unk> cap
his <unk> hit him so he <unk> him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(chorus from <unk> dream on)

but i need that spark to get <unk> back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

i don't know how or why or when, i ended up in this position i'm in

up and try to make an attempt to <unk> but i just can't admit
or come to <unk> with the fact that i may be done with rap, i need a new <unk>

and i know some shit's so hard to swallow, but i just can't sit back and <unk>

80 degree day and there's no <unk> air <unk>
and you can't see the hair is <unk>

to shop at <unk> and it became art
and i'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
at the same <unk> <unk> over the same <unk>
in the middle of the <unk> <unk> i don't give a fuck i don't <unk>
bitch you think you saw this basket <unk>
your ass backwards like motherfucking bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
mind's like a pile of clay
when's the last time you saw a <unk> with a <unk>
ripped a <unk> hole in it
flipped out, ripped down the <unk>
tied them around my neck, went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped fell straight down to the ground <unk> all over the entire state
and straight to hell got an <unk> by the gates
so satan stuck his face in an <unk>
while i <unk> around flames with a match and i gave him the gas face gibberish
and this ain't got nothing to do with a scale of being gay ya
little <unk> by the way, thoughts are getting <unk> by the day
i'm a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> and violent jay
it's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown make up and a <unk> face i'm insane
every rhyme i say, sons you, like an <unk> <unk> ray
selling hatred <unk> style all the shit you can eat
<unk> so come on and pile a plate
throwin' down the <unk> to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme spittin' while shittin' on the competition

i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm <unk> up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell

been a career asshole

if it makes you sick to your stomach acid
<unk> my <unk>

i'm sick of <unk> a square <unk> in a round hole sorry another <unk>
but your baggage ain't gonna fit in my <unk> over <unk>
cause you just ain't big enough to fit your <unk> <unk>
other words don't try to put the heart in a <unk>

"it's only up from here, i promise, you just gotta <unk>
and she took my word for it, that's all i had to say
lately i just feel so out of character
the <unk> can start to turn into <unk>
thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a <unk>
i get a blank page when i try to draw a <unk>
i'm getting straight to the point with it
need y'all to know that i never needed none of y'all niggas
fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
it's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
but i haven't <unk> with y'all boys in a minute

look, they'd rather run up on me than <unk> them goals
my niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
who you think running this <unk>
you saw it in me at 20 years old
the <unk> start to sound like we talking in code
i got a pure soul, i don't do the hate
you don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
me and <unk> used to plot on how to make a change
now me and kobe doing shots the night before the game

yesterday was the <unk> <unk> today is like the morning after
your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
<unk> and you're still a work in progress
today is a whole new <unk> it's like an enormous ass
the <unk> has passed ya, your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the <unk> bush that you
used to smell the <unk> stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the <unk> then you floor the gas <unk> and hit the corner fast, the more <unk> never looking back, may hit the curb, but everyday is a new learning <unk> as you, steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna <unk> but you have to, to <unk> a <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk> cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass, and threw dirt on your <unk> but you <unk> from the <unk> and that hurt that you have, you just <unk> to <unk> and while you're burning the past, standing at <unk> and <unk>

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

so <unk> what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive which means you must survive
although today you may <unk> because you're weak and
everything seems so bleek and <unk>
the light that you're <unk> it begins to seep in
that's the only thing keeping you from <unk> off the <unk> deep end
and i'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the <unk>
and by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
to forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
this feeling of <unk> is building and the flames are burning
quick as fire would through this building, you're <unk> in
but you're <unk> and flame <unk> you <unk> it
and as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
cause you're so over them you could put the <unk> of your foot through the ceiling

as time <unk> things change everyday
but <unk> wounds heal
but scars still <unk> the same
but tomorrow <unk> gone down in flames
throw the match at the past up place

so feel the fire beneath your feet
as you barely even <unk> from the heat
<unk> deep and breathe a <unk> of <unk>
and as you say goodbye to the <unk>50 cent

they said i rap like a <unk> so call me <unk>

but for me to rap like a computer must be in my <unk>
i got a <unk> in my back pocket
my <unk> go off when i <unk> it
got a fat knot from that rap profit

made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica <unk> feeling on his <unk>
i'm an mc still as honest

but as rude and <unk> as all hell
syllables <unk> <unk> 'em all <unk>
this <unk>
you don't really wanna get into a <unk> match with this <unk>
packing a mack in the back of the <unk> backpack rap, <unk> <unk>

and now at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical <unk> stunts while i'm practicing that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not <unk> all i do is drop <unk> feel my <unk> of attack
rappers are having a rough time <unk> here's a <unk>
it's actually <unk> bad for the wack
while i'm <unk> <unk> this <unk> yeah

'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back <unk> back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to <unk> <unk>
let me show you <unk> this shit ain't that hard, that hard

everybody want the key and the secret to rap <unk> like i have got
well, to be truthful the <unk> simply rage and <unk> <unk>
everybody loves to root for a <unk>
hit the earth like an <unk> i did nothing but shoot for the moon since
<unk>

<unk> get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a <unk> to bust the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of <unk>
me? i'm a product of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> hey doc, <unk> <unk> <unk> thank you, they got slim

inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
to meet <unk> and <unk> them into the motherfuckin' rock n'
roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i be <unk> in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you <unk> think it's all a game till i walk a <unk> of flames
off a <unk> and, tell me what in the fuck are you <unk>
little gay looking boy

so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
you <unk> a massacre
like you watching a church <unk> take place looking boy
<unk> <unk> that boy's <unk> that's all they say looking boy
you get a <unk> up, pat on the back
and a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
i get a <unk> <unk> from dre looking boy
i'mma work for everything i have
never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy
basically boy you're never gonna be <unk>
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back <unk> back nod
the way i'm racing around the track, call me <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the trailer park, the white trash god
<unk> before general <unk> this <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk>

so you be <unk> and i'll be <unk> you <unk> i'm <unk>
let off then i'm <unk> immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be <unk>
i'm the walking dead, but i'm just a talking head, a <unk> <unk>

i'm a <unk> pinch yourself in the arm and pay <unk> <unk>
it's me, my <unk> <unk>
but it's <unk> <unk> if i don't <unk> what i do though

for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i <unk> and <unk>
enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few <unk> just in case 'cause even you <unk>
rappers are hungry looking at me like it's <unk>
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the <unk> but i still rap like i'm on my <unk> <unk> grind

so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you <unk>
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to <unk> you
like that one line i said on "i'm <unk> from the mathers lp
one where i tried to say i'd take seven kids from <unk>
put 'em all in a line, add an <unk> a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm

<unk> into an <unk> coming through the <unk>
you're stuck in a time <unk> from <unk> though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're <unk> as <unk> with fucking <unk>
you write <unk> fuck being normal
and i just bought a new <unk> from the future

to just come and shoot ya like when <unk> made ray j mad

mommy wrapped the christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying

'cause daddy felt like a <unk> see daddy had a job

and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom

was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
on the <unk> in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on <unk>
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre and flew you and mama out to see me

but daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me

and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like us, talked like us
his back against the wall nigga fought like us
damn poor <unk> that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy

hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
<unk> <unk> herself she wish she could have saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men

he put his faith in the 38 in his waist
but when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before 38 and a
that's the life of what's raised by a winter, it's a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
<unk> life just ended on that <unk> day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed down at the city <unk>
open the drawer saw em <unk>
her addiction grew
prescription drugs dipped in brew
angel dust dipped in whoo
she slipped into her own <unk> world
had her self pregnant by different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasn't really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when the moon was full and the stars was just right
and the dress was real tight
and it sounded like lisa lisa i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hard head from around the way that she wanted all her life
shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when they <unk> on the bike
he was a willie all her life
he wasn't really the one to like
it was a dude named <unk>
who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but <unk> liked this broad way life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red, green and, white
hanging out the window when she first seen em fight
so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight
that would turn it to a homicide that would alter their life

<unk> forever hov for life
<unk> a <unk> first album four mics

but i don't <unk> fuck i aint do it for the hype
i do it for the hustlas for the ghetto for the <unk>
for the struggle for those who bubble white
who fly four by four <unk> cars flawless ice
for the pain for yall to know what its like

for every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
for every promise made that never saw the light
i get my own forty acres give me four nights
four o's a glock forty for the jackets and i'm right
all the four four was <unk>
a <unk> year old will look out for the vice
you can sit back and just wait for the flight
boy will take off like i've been strippin all my lifestep by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall <unk>

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his <unk>
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter

i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an <unk>
i need to be the <unk> my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever just pop off, i'm supposed to be beside 'em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy, this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit

and even though the battle was won, i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it, <unk> i'm <unk>
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for, it's not why i got in it

that was never my <unk> for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped <unk>
it wasn't my <unk> my intentions was good
i went through my whole career without ever <unk> it

now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
so i did, i just fell back, watched and <unk> my teeth

while he's all over tv down talkin' a man
who literally saved my life, like "fuck it, i <unk>
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's <unk> 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets <unk> it ain't just words no more is it?

it's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

until ja started <unk> in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some <unk> at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an <unk> for me and thinks that i'll be his <unk>
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that <unk> the same one that made me famous<unk>
remember me? seven <unk>
remember me? i have no remorse
remember me? i'm high <unk>
remember me? i drop bombs like <unk>

for this one it's the x, you <unk>
'cause i grab the mic and get down like syndrome
hide and roam into the <unk>
without <unk> which <unk> me for the <unk> <unk>
without no <unk> i leak words that's <unk>
like i'm not the one you wanna <unk> see
'cause i'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch that got banned from tv
<unk> <unk>
hit you watch your whole head split up
loco is the <unk> we comin' through
hollow tips is the lead, the forty-five threw

sticky <unk>

remember me? <unk>

niggas that take no for an answer, get told, <unk>
yeah, i been told no but it was more like, "no, no, <unk>
life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
better come better than better to be a <unk>
this <unk> is ahead of the shit is all <unk> you <unk> and <unk>
a medic instead of the <unk> and <unk>
settle <unk> with metal <unk> from ghetto to ghetto
<unk> nope, never leave a <unk>

from my blueprint <unk> to my black album ending
if you listen close you'll hear what i'm about
nigga feel my <unk>

[verse 1]
pop died didn't cry didn't know him that well
between him doin heroin and me doin crack sales
put that in an <unk> standing at the <unk> rather the church
pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
so a <unk> was all on my face
like damn that man's face is just like my face
so pop i forgive you for all the shit that i lived through
i wasn't all your fault homie you got caught
into the same game i fought
that uncle ray lost
my big brothers and so many others i saw
i'm just glad we got to see each other
talk and <unk> meet each other
save a place in heaven for the next time we meet forever

[chorus]
[verse 2]
the music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me
hustlers and <unk> <unk> me and the music i be makin

<unk> i wanna rhyme like common sense
(but i did 5 <unk> i ain't been <unk> like common sense
when your sense got that much in common and you been hustlin' since

since i know what i'm up against we as rappers must decide what is most <unk>
and i can't help the poor if i'm one of them

but i can't sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the <unk> and
no one decides who the definition of talent is
and mrs. <unk> look at what my talent did
and what yo' business is
it's been a couple years
guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you <unk> it
its always awkward to dummy a nigga artist

nick cannon and will never did it this ill<div <unk> sometimes you just feel tired,
feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.
but you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a <unk> no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

yo left, yo left, yo left right left

till i <unk> spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
till the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killing them
'cause when i am not then i'ma stop <unk> 'em
and i am not hip-hop and just not <unk>
<unk> thoughts when i'm stop sending them women are caught in <unk> spin and <unk> venom
adrenaline shots of <unk> could not get the <unk> to stop.
<unk> is just not real <unk>
the criminal cop killing hip-hop <unk> a <unk> <unk> to cop millions of pac <unk>
you're coming with me, feel it or not gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
you hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop <unk> up.
for <unk> my <unk> this is the plot listen up you <unk> forgot <unk> does not give a <unk>

till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

music is like magic a certain feeling you get when you're real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit.
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
so while in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its <unk>
'cause i'm at the end of my <unk> with half this shit that gets in.
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
it goes <unk> jay-z, tupac and <unk> andre from <unk> <unk> <unk> nas and then me.
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of <unk> so when not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's <unk> me.
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
you hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
the <unk> wet dream like bobby and <unk> nate hit me.

till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
