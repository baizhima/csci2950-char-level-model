in love she saw him falling for her in the fire of july
then one day as the nights grew longer
blackberry winter in a little white church
stood a young pretty bride

nothing ever stays the same
forever named
forever changed

she remembers the change in her body
the blooming within
and how her heart seemed to <unk> with the wind
then one night as the days grew longer
that indian summer
she brought love into the world
cried and held me then

forever changed
nothing ever stays the same
forever child
forever changed

some days talk about aunt <unk>
the sister she lost
asking when coming over
and why she called
some days i just hold her <unk> hand
as tom <unk> across the floor
some days it just kills me
to watch her memories slip away a little more

forever changed
nothing ever stays the same
forever named
forever child
forever loved
forever <unk>here we lay face to face once again
the silence cuts like a knife as we <unk>
and i'm wondering who will be the first
to say what we both know
we're just holding on to could have <unk>
and we should be letting go.

it feels like you're a million miles away
as your lying here with me tonight
i can't even find the words to say
i can find a way to make it right
and we both know that the <unk> ending,
we play the part but we're just pretending
and i can hide the tears
cause even though you're here,
it feels like you're a million miles away.

was it me, or was it you that broke away?

<unk> up the sun, he is a real lover
making up the past
and feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure before
a jaw dropper

he would be hard to chase
but good to catch
and he could change the world with his hands behind his back
oh

you can find him sitting on your doorstep
waiting for the surprise
it will feel like he's been there for hours
and you can tell that he'll be there for life

daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt
he lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
when he shouldn't be
but he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you through
there's no way i could describe him
what i'll say is, just what i'm hoping for

see that was a <unk> i believe the matter
is what happens after the <unk> where the leaves just <unk>
where the <unk> <unk> get <unk> and <unk> hoods flip up
drugs dealers standin and they <unk> hoods slip up
where girls become exes from summer's caught <unk>
the winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
and some places is <unk> and some it start <unk>
and if you planning family <unk> you better know when
but some <unk> scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a <unk> that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late, she seen them <unk>
where <unk> college <unk> pouring water on their <unk>

[talking: over chorus]
yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls <unk> wanna get <unk> you might think they the one
but just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[verse 2:]
forget to <unk> this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet
since i'm driving, i ask her how to get the suite
she doesn't <unk> opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
she's bold but i roll with it, i'm impressed cause she's sweet
then she says "i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat,
i mean, the lyrics are good, but i'm obsessed with the beat
i love it when <unk> sings and the chorus is good,
there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you <unk>
off this i'm kinda takin it back for a second,
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do, and it's kind of <unk> the surface hard to scratch
until we end up <unk> and now my heart attached
i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern
and realizing all that she wanted was that <unk> lovin and ho!

[talking: over chorus]
yeah, uh, i told ya'll i had a story for you right
uh, ya man, it's what it is

[verse 3:]
and now, i'm proud to have her like <unk> to the <unk>
she love to play hurt like carter did on the <unk>
but, my boy say i'm <unk> different, because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and <unk>
she tellin everyone imma hold here down
tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her,
instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
but then spring shows up, and it's dallas in this bitch
the weather starts to <unk> the holidays she missed
when we were together it <unk> like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play <unk> and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for <unk> she saving for <unk>
and it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
i <unk> i lost another one to the wintertime

<unk> + <unk>
i miss you, most of <unk> <unk> <unk> [beat fades <unk>
<unk> a second to gather my <unk>
<unk> back <unk> strolling in the park (ho!)
and watching winter turn to spriing (such a beautiful day man)

strolling in the <unk> and watching winter turn to spriing
(i'm still standing on two feet, even after this <unk> <unk>
<unk> but i got something to else to tell ya baby)

[rap:]
i remember them encore <unk> breakfast and the wake up
now drake's committed we waiting on the <unk>
so we can get back to them <unk> nights
with dress <unk> and light skinned girls that won't act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her,
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and we'd <unk> a <unk> a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
we had <unk> hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
but this summer is different it's a two man <unk>
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause handin' them crack is a one man <unk>
instead of <unk> i walk in sweat pants and <unk> <unk>
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
the face, the <unk> the <unk> the toes
i'm still solo and a long night <unk> to a close
cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
we'll never talk again, scary and true
that song special i recorded with <unk> well it's like a <unk>
it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through
yet i can't seem to find a heavy girl that <unk> it
only wants a friendship <unk> me to forget the shit
and when they talk about they past and lovers
and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
there's also room for <unk> as soon as june arrive

i needed to hear that shit, i hate when you're <unk>
<unk> aggressive when we're <unk> i feel the distance
i look around the <unk> that surround me, these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
started realizing a couple places i can take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money, <unk> vacation
and <unk> a generation that's lacking in patience
i've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
we've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
well, fuck it, we had a couple <unk>
we might have rolled a white <unk> just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should <unk> it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child, beautiful child, i'm in your zone
looking like you came from the <unk> on your own
my mother is <unk> and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and <unk>
y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something i'm missing and disappear when i'm bored
but girl, what <unk> was i looking for before?
who you settling for? who better for you than the boy, <unk>

cause i love me, i love me enough for the both of us

when i got summer a michael <unk> with my <unk> debit
a weak attempt at <unk> i'll never forget it
cause that night i played her three songs
then we talked about something we <unk> on
then she started telling me how i'll never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now it's <unk> blowing money in a <unk>
or <unk> center macy's where i discovered <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
the one that i needed was <unk> from <unk> on <unk> street
i've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on <unk>
know we were going through some shit, name a couple that
remember our talk in the parking lot at the <unk>
girl i felt we had it all planned out, guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true <unk> of my selfish decisions
when you find out how living i just hope forgiven
it seems like you want this love anymore
acting out in the open hard for you to ignore
but girl, what <unk> was i looking for before?
who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

cause i love me, i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me, i know you been through more than most of us

about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken, and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
did you know that i loved you or were you not aware?
you're the smile on my face
and i ain't going nowhere
i'm here to make you happy, i'm here to see you smile
i've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

well i can tell you're afraid of what this might do
cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
well i don't wanna lose it either
i don't think i can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
so take my hand
well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
cause i know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall
but if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your...
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

so fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall

you can fly away with me

when the sun shines on the ground

it shows where your mind has gone

and you swear to your parents
that it will never happen again
i know, i know
what that <unk> i know

that you all have guns
and you never put the safety on
and you all have plans
to take it, to take it
don't take it, take it, take it

i'm trying, i'm trying to sleep
but i can't, but i can't when you all have
guns for hands, yeah

i'm trying, i'm trying to sleep
but i can't, but i can't when you all have

let's take this a second at a time
let's take this one song, this one rhyme
together, let's breathe
together, to the beat

but there's hope out the window
so that's where we'll go
let's go outside and all join hands
but until then, you'll never understand

that you all have guns
and you never put the safety on
and you all have plans
to take it, to take it
don't take it, take it, take it

i'm trying, i'm trying to sleep
but i can't, but i can't when you all have
guns for hands, yeah

we've turned our hands to guns
trade in our thumbs for ammunition
i must forewarn you
of my disorder, or my condition
'cause when the sun sets
it <unk> what's left of my invested interest
interested in putting my fingers
to my head

the <unk> is
i see a whole room of these <unk> kids
fused at the wrist
i simply tell them they should shoot at this
simply suggest my chest
and this confused music, it's
obviously best for them
to turn their guns to a fist

i'm trying, i'm trying to sleep
but i can't, but i can't when you all have
guns for hands, yeah

i'm trying, i'm trying to sleep
but i can't, but i can't when you all have
guns for hands, yeahwhere 69 meets 40
there's a single stop light town
and back when i was really young
part of that burned down
on any given friday night
we'd drive a hundred miles
between the <unk> and the <unk> store
laughing all the while
with as many friends as i could pack
in my daddy's ford
but i ain't in checotah anymore

my hotel in <unk>
holds more people than our town
and what i just paid for dinner
would be a down <unk> on a house
i'd rather be tipping <unk> in <unk>
then <unk> cabs here in new york
but i ain't in checotah anymore

i'm in a world so wide
it makes me feel small sometimes
i miss the big blue sky
the oklahoma kind

in a world of long red <unk>
the bright lights of hollywood
all the paparazzi flashing
can make a girl feel pretty good
you can get anything you want here
except a <unk> store
but i ain't in checotah anymore

i'm in a world so wide
it makes me feel small sometimes
i miss the big blue sky
the oklahoma kind

where the <unk> beat the <unk> heads
old <unk> day and the <unk> <unk>
after prom down at the <unk> <unk>
catching <unk> fish in <unk> lake
i ain't in checotah anymore

oh yeah
i'm in a world so wide
it makes me feel small sometimes
i miss the big blue skies
the oklahoma kind

but i ain't in checotah
no i ain't in checotah
oh, there's nothing like oklahoma

where 69 meets 40
there's a single stop light townjustin bieber

i'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
i wanna tell you but there's too many people round
you know i love you, i care but it's <unk>
i ain't perfect but i'm tryna be the best i can
if it's real than its gon' come back again
so i'm letting go, i hope you understand
all your friends say, he don't love you
and the grown ups say it's puppy
love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
that i thought
loving you, it was us against the world
you my favorite girl, for you i would go to war
i, take this all in just to show you
or maybe i'm just stuck in the moment

cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget it, yeah

in a fairytale, no malice and no lies
baby oh, it's hard to believe
that the love you have to give is only mine
that's how i know
i can't be your only one
no i, can't be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i can't
i can't be your only one
no i, can't be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i can't

<unk> <unk>
(be your only <unk>[drake]
all night i've, been starin
can you tell i want you?
can't be too, wide open
there's <unk> i won't do <unk>
just thought you should <unk>

[chorus: drake]
that's when you start to laugh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
sayin i just want what i can't have (oh-oh, oh-oh)
won't even give me a chance (oh-oh, oh-oh)
<unk> i'm just not as serious as you, shorty if you only knew
this is serious <unk>

[drake]
<unk>
i wish i, wasn't famous
i wish i, was still in school
so that i could have you in my <unk> room
i would put it on you, crazy

[chorus]
<unk> <unk> guitar solo for <unk> <unk>
[drake]
<unk> <unk>now is the climax to the story
that gives the demons and angels purpose
they fly around while we are walking
and mold our emotions just to please them

i am cold, can you hear
i will fly, with no hope, no fear
and the ground, taunts my wings
plummet as i sing, plummet as i sing

all we are is an <unk> of <unk> birds
we find our worth in giving birth and stuff
we're lining our homes against <unk> <unk>
and we think the going is tough
we pick songs to sing, remind us of things that no body cares about
and honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now
if you decide to live by, what you <unk> wrong and what's right
believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
your <unk> will creep in your head and you'll cry
but if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
we can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free

i am cold, can you hear
i will fly, with no hope, no fear
and the ground, taunts my wings
plummet as i sing, plummet as i

i am cold, can you hear
i will fly, with no hope, no fear
and the ground, taunts my wings
plummet as i sing, plummet as i

how <unk> and so <unk>
his time, we're wasting
and time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading
and he is waiting, oh so <unk>
while we repeat the same routine as we will please <unk>
please think about why you can't sleep in the evening
and please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
and it's time you pick your <unk> and i promise you this is mineyeah, oh you gotta love it
oh you got, oh you gotta love it
i heard what <unk> let's get to the bottom of it
i told <unk> send me something and i got it covered
somehow always rise above it
why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album <unk>
the game is all mine and i'm mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better <unk>
every shot you see them take at me? they all <unk>
<unk> <unk> shoe deal, these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep, wanted more
tried to decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
<unk> at <unk> wonder what's next for me
<unk> wonder how long they'll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but can't change it alone
i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe
that's quite a <unk> you <unk> you shoulda kept it inside
oh you tried
it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your <unk> age
it gets worse by the <unk> my <unk> like a how to <unk>
so i guess it's <unk> man
oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
to show they <unk> off, guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
i'm <unk> by my friends that i grew up with
i'd rather give that <unk> to people i fuck with
if me and future hadn't made it with this rappin'
we prolly be out in <unk> tryna get our <unk> on
but here we are, yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
they scream out my <unk> and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my messages like we have words
and stories 'bout my life hit the <unk> like a bad serve
bitter women i'm <unk> are <unk> crazy this year
fuckin' with my image
i've been tryna reach the youth so i can save 'em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
bout how we need protection from those <unk> the block
nobody lookin' out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even <unk> about it
damn, i just had to say my piece about it
oh you gotta love it
but they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
that's a hotter subject
i've been <unk> mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins
shout out to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> southern <unk>
part of my <unk> pardon my <unk> part in my hair again
that's that comeback flow, comeback flow
once i start it's apparent
i'm with girl whose ass is so big that's <unk> <unk>
but fuck all the <unk> and fuck your <unk>
and fuck all the judgement
your content so aggressive lately, what's <unk> you?
shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
i wanna prove that i'm number one over all these niggas
bein' number two is just being the first to lose
my city <unk> music, nobody seein' us

<unk> i ever <unk> seems like a decade ago
<unk> flow and i still got a decade to go
oh please, take it <unk> where's the love and the peace
why you rappin' like you come from the <unk>
i got a <unk> where money seems to come from the trees
and i'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
phantom <unk> like the shit just hit a <unk> of <unk>
i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
special order for anybody that's comin' for me
shit you probably flinch if somebody <unk>
you see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, <unk> and me
cuttin' all loose ends, i be the barber for free
i'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
feel like i'm in the <unk> that had the cloth on the seats
man, oh you gotta love it
and on top of that it's getting harder to eat
rappers <unk> houses
putting cars on the <unk>
to think labels said they had a problem <unk> me

and me and you belong

i wanna run, run
smash into you

ears closed, what i hear no one else has to know.

if there's anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if you're looking for a purpose

you put the <unk> in the <unk> and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was <unk>

now i'm all singing karaoke

so if you gotta go
if there's any way i can help

isn't it ironic that the girl i wanna marry is a wedding planner
that tells 'em my life is too much and moves to atlanta
damn, of all the places you could go
i just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

i always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
i hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady

i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
don't be fooled by the money i'm still young and just unlucky
i'm surprised you couldn't tell

but the spotlight makes you nervous

back in control, no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost
"t"s uncrossed and "i"s undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot
like flesh is all i got
not any more, flesh out the door, swat

i must've forgot, you can't trust me
i'm open a moment and close when you show it
before you know it i'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it
and the story unfolds
you should take my life
you should take my soul

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment
you know exactly where you're going
'cause the next moment, before you know it
time is slowing and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith

back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to <unk>
feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for <unk>
then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he was <unk> doin' <unk> out of your basement
he let us hit the weed on <unk> for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
feel like i never say much but man there's a lot to know
feel like the difference between us really <unk> to show
i'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
i mean you boys not even coming close
i gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
you number one and i'm eddie <unk> we <unk> places
lookin' in the mirror i'm closer than i really appear
creepin' like chilli without the <unk> love, and care
no tender love and care and no love and affection
i got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
i might be here as a <unk> to teach people the lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
yeah, but here we are and it's a new <unk>
40 the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
a lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
your best day is my worst day, i get green like earth day
you treat me like i'm born <unk> you forgot my birthday
you don't be <unk> perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
you platinum like rappers on <unk> boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was <unk>
and then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and did it with a purpose
used to have secret <unk> to confirm my <unk>
nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the <unk>
a lot of people just hit me up when my name is <unk>
shout out to <unk> we relate we get the same attention

now the talk of the corner store is that i'm <unk>
the best <unk> don't ever <unk> you know better
but shit ain't always how it seems when it's <unk> together
yeah, i let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
weston road flows, my confidence level gettin' <unk>
don't get <unk> for the moment then start to <unk>
don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
to talk <unk> i really do this
been flowin' stupid since <unk> carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit

y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
to busy face <unk> on waste <unk>

but money can't buy happiness, <unk> talkin' <unk>
but i'm happiest when i can buy what i want
get high when i want
yeah, that's right
yeah[verse 1:]
took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
opened up, let you in my world
like a dance, started slow and then love took control
swept away, so proud to be your girl
when you read a story much to fast
sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

[chorus:]
now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when this ride is so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know

[verse 2:]
remember <unk> we said our love would last forever
but then again, how are we to know
there come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
a sunny day will suddenly turn cold
time will teach you all you need to learn
but there'll always be a first time you get burned

[chorus:]
now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when this ride is so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know

[hook:]
i don't regret a single day
joy and pain along the way
a broken heart's the price we pay
as sad as it may seem
baby can't you see
it's the way it's gotta be

[chorus:]
now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing

i trusted him, but when i followed you
i saw you together

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

so petrified
i'm so scared to step into this ride
what if i lose my heart and fail the <unk>
i won't forgive me if i give up trying

i heard his voice today
i didn't know a single word he said
not one <unk> to the man i met
just a <unk> and broken boy instead

but i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i am willing to take the risk

there will be times we'll try and give it up
<unk> at the seams, no doubt
we'll almost fall apart, then burn the pieces
to watch them turn to <unk> but nothing will ever <unk> us

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i am willing to take the risk

will he
will he still remember me?
will he still love me even when he's free?
or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?

when we spoke yesterday
he said to hold my breath and sit and wait
i'll be home so soon, i won't be late

he won't go
he can't do it on his own
if this ain't love, then what is?
he's willing to take the risk

so i won't go
he can't do it on his own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

'cause he won't go
he can't do it on his own
if this ain't love, then what is?
we're willing to take the risk

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk[verse 1 - drake]
uh, when did you get like this
least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
i don't regret like this
so i'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
saying, this just ain't my style
you can't say you're happy either
you don't even smile, for me

[chorus - peter, bjorn &amp; john]
did you agree, we should let it be
and did you agree, it's a must,
let's call the whole thing off
we used to had enough of us

[verse 2 - drake]
when you decided to knock on my door
did you remember what happened before
the look on your face said you were expecting more
but some things look better inside of the store

[chorus - peter, bjorn &amp; john]
did you agree, we should let it be
and did you agree, it's a must,
let's call the whole thing off
we used to had enough of us

[verse 3 - drake]
leave me, leave me, i can't fuckin stand you
wish i had the <unk> to say everything i planned to
my girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
tell me that we <unk> to be together til the world end
but, i don't really feel that
i just really wanna turn the <unk> back
give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
convince you that time will heal that
uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
i swear everytime i call
you jus tell me how i don't call you
why you do that... do that... do that
yeah

[chorus - peter, bjorn &amp; john]
did you agree, we should let it be
and did you agree, it's a must,
let's call the whole thing off
we used to had enough of uswe all are stranger <unk> than when we all started out as kids,
culture <unk>
we have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is,
to fall off the <unk>

we live for the night's decor,
it <unk> what we dream <unk>

i know there's someone at the door,
they called for help, of this i'm sure,
but do i want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
i'm holding on to what i know,
and what i know, i must let go,
but i would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

we all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great,
i know some people who know people who are flying straight,
but i'll kindly enter into rooms of depression,
while ceiling fans and <unk> hands will take my life again.

we live for the night's decor,
it <unk> what we dream <unk>

i know there's someone at the door,
they called for help, of this i'm sure,
but do i want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
i'm holding on to what i know,
and what i know, i must let go,
but i would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

this room is far too dark for us to stay around,
redemption's not that far and darkness is going down.
make them stop.

i'm holding on to what i know,
and what i know, i must let go,
but i would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.
make them stop.[intro: rick ross]

it's your worst <unk> it's my first night here

so i'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there, i don't trust these hoes at all
but that's just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple <unk> stars that i'm ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna my only role models
<unk> and jordan my only role models
that's why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
bottom <unk> and <unk> and some bracelets and <unk>
all of the little <unk> that make me a king
i never hear the <unk> they try and point out to me
but it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
i'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about christmas in <unk>
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some <unk> a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs. <unk> they're making the cookie stretch
i know it so well, i know the hustle so well

lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
with my new bitch that's living in palm <unk>
young ass nigga, <unk> dreams
they take the <unk> from the past and compare us
i wonder if they'd ever survive in this <unk>
in a time where it's <unk>
to pull all your <unk> out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be <unk> fun at
never the flow though, they know i run that
fuck you all, i claim that whenever
i change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
<unk> i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne at forever
i'm a <unk> of either marley or hendrix
i haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
i'm hearing all of the <unk> i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin' emotion don't ever mean i'm a pussy
know that i don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows, lord knows, i'm heavy, i got my weight up
<unk> boost your <unk> up, it's time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me, then who should i be afraid of?
bought a white ghost, now shit is gettin' <unk>
<unk> very <unk> like shit you see in the movies

to make you feel my love

and on the highway of regret

i told you so, oh, i told you so
i told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
i told you so, but you had to go
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

if i got down on my knees and told you i was yours forever
would you get down on yours too and take my hand
would we get that old time feeling, would we laugh and talk for hours
the way we did when our love first began

would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
and you've waited for the day that i <unk>
and we'd live in love forever and that i'm your one and only
or would you say the tables finally turned

when you know it's the truth
nobody else can do it quite like i do
all my kisses
and my loving
but ain't nobody better than us

now i look back on the time
that we spent and i
see it in my mind
playing over and over again
'cause boy right now

i wish that you come hold me
when i'm lonely
when i need someone to talk to

you would phone me
just like everything you told me
(when we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

and now we'll let the memories just fade away
but i remember what you used to say

cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man

i'd listen to her
cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off the phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleeping alone

i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
cause i know that she'd be faithful
waiting for me to come home
to come home

if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

you don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
how it feels to love a girl
someday you'll wish you were a better man

until you lose the one you wanted
cause you've taken her for granted
and everything that you had got destroyed

i know that shit is <unk> <unk> your mistakes are <unk> girl...
and maybe you don't need the help, but i just gotta see for myself.when i first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
you had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
i only wanted to kick it, so i said 'cool, you can keep her'
long as you satisfy me
but as the weeks went by i, i started feelin' strange
somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' i can't explain
i think i'm fallin' in love with you boy
i'm needing you so much, i'm cryin' just to feel your touch
i gotta leave you

i didn't want no man
i didn't wanna fall in love, and
i didn't care about your girl
i didn't care how we would end up

but that was then, this is now
i think i'm <unk> love
i don't wanna wreck up your home
that's why i'm <unk> i gotta go

when i first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
you had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
i only wanted to kick it, so i said 'cool, you can keep her'
long as you satisfy me
but as the weeks went by i, i started feelin' strange
somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' i can't explain
i think i'm fallin' in love with you boy
i'm needing you so much, i'm cryin' just to feel your touch
i gotta leave you

everytime she calls, you expect
me to disappear like we never met
at first i didn't mind, but now i
sometimes feel like you're all mine

you told me it was all about me, me
it's not about me if your still with her
now i've realized that i've gotta move on
it might be hard, but i,
i gotta move on

when i first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
you had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
i only wanted to kick it, so i said 'cool, you can keep her'

somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' i can't explain
i think i'm fallin' in love with you boy
i'm needing you so much, i'm cryin' just to feel your touch
i gotta leave you

i gotta leave you (gotta leave you)i was sitting on my doorstep
hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
but i knew i had to do it
and he wouldn't understand

so hard to see myself without him
i felt a piece of my heart break
but when you're standing at a crossroad
there's a choice you gotta make

chorus:
i guess it's gonna have to hurt
i guess i'm gonna have to cry
and let go of some things i've loved
to get on to the other side
i guess it's gonna break me down
like falling when you're trying to fly
it's <unk> but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
starts with goodbye

i know there's a blue horizon
somewhere up ahead just waiting for me
but getting there means leaving things behind
sometimes life's so bittersweet

(repeat chorus)
time heals the wounds you feel somehow
but right now

(repeat chorus)you said "i come in <unk> so i took you home
i gave you food and i gave you clothes
i taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on

where the sky can't rain on me anymore
don't knock on my door 'cause i won't come

you ain't gonna get to me tonight
i'll lay right here 'til it all rolls through
i ain't gonna raise my body 'til there ain't no sign
'til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign of you

'cause i'm flat on the floor with my head down low
where the sky can't rain on me anymore
don't knock on my door 'cause i won't come
i'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is

i'm flat on the floor with my head down low
where the sky can't rain on me anymore
don't knock on my door 'cause i won't come

i'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
i wanna tell you but there's too many people round
you know i love you, i care but it's <unk>
i ain't perfect but i'm tryna be the best i can
if it's real than its gon' come back again
so i'm letting go, i hope you understand
all your friends say, he don't love you
and the grown ups say it's puppy
love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
that i thought
loving you, it was us against the world
you my favorite girl, for you i would go to war
i, take this all in just to show you
or maybe i'm just stuck in the moment

justin bieber
now romeo &amp; juliet
bet they never felt the way we felt
bonnie &amp; clyde
never had to hide like
we do

you and i, both know it can't work
it's all fun and games
'til someone gets hurt
and i don't
i won't let that be you

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're trippin' in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam &amp; eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny &amp; cher
i don't care
i got you baby

see we both
fightin' every inch of our fibers
'cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
we are both too foolish to stop

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
and we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
and i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
baby we both have the right to disagree
and i ain't with it
and i don't wanna be so old and gray
reminiscing 'bout these better days
but convince just telling us to let go
so we'll never know

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
'cause everything we did
and everything we have is stuck in the moment

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
(oh no no)
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
(nothing my heart can do)
to fight with time and space
(and space)
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

yeahwhen the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i will never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong

i'd go hungry, i'd go black and blue
and i'd go crawling down the avenue
no there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love

the storms are raging on the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me, yet

i could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my lovewhy do i feel so alone
like everybody passing through the studio
is in character as if we acting out a movie role
talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
and i don't have the heart to give these
bitch ass niggas the <unk> to go
so they stick around kicking out feedback
and i entertaining as if i need that
i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
my <unk> about the only thing i need back
but it's hard to think of them polite flows
mr. <unk> <unk> suits on your night clothes

you can hold onto the <unk> like a <unk>
just close your eyes and see your life
like the air

you can <unk> into the strength you never knew you had
you can breathe into your faith no matter where at
just close your eyes and change your life
like the air

like the air you can
rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
you can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
yes, i know there are those who will wanna bring you down
but you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
like the air you can rise
rise

the earth can pull you down with all its gravity
and the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
so just hold on, when the night is done
like the sun

like the air you can
rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
you can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
yes, i know there are those who will wanna bring you down
but you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
like the air you can rise
rise

so even when your bones feel like <unk>
and hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
you can still find a <unk> place
close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
be alright, just jealous of your highs
so they can knock you down, but

like the air you can
rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
you can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
yes, i know there are those who will wanna bring you down
but you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
like the air you can rise
<unk>fool that i am for falling in love with you
and fool that i am for thinking you loved me too

you took my heart then played the part of little <unk>
and my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette

fool that i am for hoping you'd understand
and thinking you would listen to all of the things
the things i had planned

but we couldn't see eye to eye

fool that i am
ooh
i still care
fool that i amfound myself today singing out your name
you said i'm crazy
if i am i'm crazy for you

sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
turns me crazy
but it's you who makes me lose my head

and every time i'm meant to be acting sensible
you drift into my head
and turn me into a crumbling fool

tell me to run and i'll race
if you want me to stop i'll freeze
and if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby
and make me crazy for you
crazy for you

lately with this state i'm in i can't help myself but spin
i wish you'd come over
send me spinning closer to you

my oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
strips me down bare
and gets me into my favourite mood

i keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
but the more i do
the crazier i turn into

pacing floors and opening doors
hoping you'll walk through
and save me boy
because i'm too crazy for you
crazy for youi've been walking in the same way as i did
missing all the cracks in the pavement
and tutting my heel and strutting my feet

<unk> path that we're on, two <unk> but we

a cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet,
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

i wanna feel it like a kick drum,
beating faster in your chest
i wanna feel you holding onto me
and make me hold my breath

ruby lips, a lost temptation
i shake my hips in celebration, baby

and there's no telling what you're gonna do
toss me out like yesterday's news
make it hard for me to like you, baby

and i was happy for you, this i know
i heard it on the radio
and i miss you more with every day
but really, we work well this way
so you go your way, and i'll go mine

now someone tell me why i even care
right it down, somewhere, i'll meet you there
who said loving you was ever fair, baby?

now forgive me for wanting everything <unk>
write me off because i gave a shit
don't you worry, i'll get over it, baby

but i was happy for you this i know
i heard it on the radio
and i miss you more with every day
but really, we work well this way

and at least parts are always healing
though the thought of you leaves me reeling
but at least i know i'm still feeling
at least i still know

and surely there's an explanation
ruby lips, a lost temptation
i shake my hips in celebration, babyyeah
check

sometimes i feel like <unk> and <unk> <unk> are the only ones with enough
to feel what i'm about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
it is when all the press <unk> happening and the cameras get to <unk>
and they try to make you out as a lie
<unk> cuz you were just trying to please em' by using logic and reason
it's a <unk> why even try
when your ideas so <unk> get <unk> and people just get <unk>
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
to try and make em a mill
you never <unk> the fact you might be working what i'm <unk> at first
and niggas wanna say that you ain't around
i mean there's always some blame to put on <unk> 'stead of <unk> you couldn't help
and maybe next time you ain't in town

chorus:
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try, try-try-try

and the managers make you <unk> to pressure and you spittin' the pressure
than most of the rappers running the game
concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit to cash
there's time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i ran
sometimes i wish that i woulda just <unk> on the sneakers and watched the game from the <unk>
cuz i'm really telling me what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother don't <unk> for the other time
i wasted late out at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i working hard on the winner
so this album is a <unk> of love
you say as long as i'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
then she can rest without a toss or a turn
cuz she know that my reputation <unk> me and people watch me on tv
that's exactly why i often get burned
but i'm gonna try <unk>

try harder cuz
try, try-try-tryyeah, yeah
what you got if you ain't got love?
the kind that you just want to give away
it's okay to open up
go ahead and let the light shine through
i know it's hard on a rainy day
you wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
but don't run out on your faith

'cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
is just a grain of sand
and what you've been out there searching for forever
is in your hands
and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else
seem so small

it's so easy to get lost inside
a problem that seems so big at the time
it's like a river that's so wide
it <unk> you whole
while you're sitting 'round thinking about what you can't change
and <unk> about all the wrong things
time's flying by, moving so fast
you better make it count, 'cause you can't get it back

sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
is just a grain of sand
and what you've been out there searching for forever
is in your hands
oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else
seem so <unk> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
is just a grain of sand
and what you've been out there searching for forever
is in your hands
and then you figure out love is all that matters after all

and i need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
but my heart is a <unk> it's so <unk> and man made
i'm scared to death if i let you in that you'll see i'm just a fake
sometimes i feel lonely in the arms of your touch
but i know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
when i was a child i grew up by the river lea
there was something in the water, now that something's in me
oh i can't go back, but the <unk> are growing out of my fingertips
i can't go back to the river

but it's in my roots, in my veins
it's in my blood and i stain every heart that i use to heal the pain
oh, it's in my roots, in my veins

so i blame it on the river lea, the river lea, the river lea
yeah i blame it on the river lea, the river lea, the river lea

i should probably tell you now before it's way too late
that i never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
consider this my apology, i know it's years in advance
but i'd rather say it now in case i never get the chance
no i can't go back, but the <unk> are growing out of my fingertips
i can't go back to the river

but it's in my roots, in my veins
it's in my blood and i stain every heart that i use to heal the pain
oh, it's in my roots, in my veins

so i blame it on the river lea, the river lea, the river lea
yeah i blame it on the river lea, the river lea, the river lea

river lea, river lea
the river <unk>this here is on some <unk> shit
it seems like everything i do, your used to it
and i hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
so then i gotta hide, what i'm feeling inside
so you still think i'm confident and damn
is this gonna last? your up on a pedestal
are we moving too <unk>
feel like i'm in crazy competition with the past
is why i gotta <unk>

is anything i'm doing brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

this here is something personal
i highly doubt this feeling is <unk>
knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
that you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
so i don't ever question you and damn
i cant even find, the perfect brush
so i can paint whats going through my mind
racing against myself, but i'm a couple <unk> behind
this why i gotta ask,

is anything i'm doing brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

is anything i'm doing brand <unk>
or is everything i'm doing too <unk>

did he take off your clothes off just like this
did he give you loving just like this
did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
tell me baby am i too late?

is anything i'm doing brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
show me if this is brand new?

yeah, yeah yeah...where'd you go, huh?
they all think i know you,
it's so hard to <unk>
me to <unk> a,
single inch of me to,
something i can't see i,
don't mean to <unk> but why,
would you even make the <unk>
i don't believe my <unk>
and i'm scared of my own head,
i will deny you for years,
then i'll make you raise me from the dead,
and if i said that i would live for you,
for nothing in <unk>
well i'm sorry mr. <unk>
but <unk> all i've <unk>
so be concerned.

no music,
and i could talk about anything,
whether or not it's worth while,
is based on who's listening,
most of us listen if <unk>
something we can relate to,
all of us <unk>
if it's something we've just been through,
take it for granted,
trust is damaged and now we <unk>
living <unk>
living lives like we can't <unk> i can't feel you,
but still know where home is feeling like <unk> did,
almost dropped the bat like every base was <unk> <unk>
so be concerned.

i am <unk>
inside my <unk> eye <unk>
i try to say goodbye, <unk> and deny,
what it is i'm <unk>
clearly i am dying, <unk> i am <unk>
<unk> <unk> that the test to fly <unk> i,
pass the test with colors <unk>
i don't believe you most the time,
i'm lying 'cause i say i am fine,
you are the <unk> i am the <unk>
so break my life and take this <unk>
i'm so sorry but i do believe,
that all my <unk> i have <unk>
and i've earned a policy of no <unk>
so be concerned.this whiskey got me feelin pretty
so pardon if i'm <unk>
i just really need your ass with me
i'm sorry about the other night
and i know i could be more creative
and come up with <unk> lines
but i'm turnt up upstairs and i love you

honesty is such a lonely word;
everyone is so untrue...
honesty is hardly ever heard,
and mostly what i need from you...

i can always find someone to say they <unk>
if i wear my heart out on my <unk>
but i don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty <unk>
all i want is someone to believe...

honesty is such a lonely word;
everyone is so untrue...
honesty is hardly ever heard,
and mostly what i need from you...

i can find a lover, i can find a <unk>
i can have security until the bitter end...
anyone can comfort me with promises again, i know...

<unk> is such a lonely word;
everyone is so untrue...
honesty is hardly ever <unk>

but you are out of my mind,

heard you say, "not today, "
tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
heard your voice, "there's no choice, "
tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a <unk>

don't you test me though, just because i play the piano,
doesn't mean i am not willing to take you down, i'm sorry

i'm out of my mind, i'm not seeing things right,
i waste all this time trying to run from you,
but i'm out of my <unk>

as i start the car, and then i begin
to add the miles <unk> up behind me
i barely feel a smile deep inside me

and i begin to envy the headlights driving south
i want to crack the door so i can just fall out
but then i remember when you packed my car
you reached in the back and <unk> up your heart
for me to drive away with
i begin to understand why god <unk>

the demons sat there waiting on her porch
it was a little dark so we held a <unk> torch
and when my car was far out of sight
he <unk> in her room and stayed there for the night

and then i felt chills in my bones
the breath i saw was not my own
i knew my skin that wrapped my frame
wasn't made to play this game
and then i saw him, torch in hand
he laid it out, what he had planned
and then i said i'll take the grave
please just send them all my way

i began to understand why god died
the air begins to feel a little thin
as we're waiting for the morning to begin
but for now you told me to hold this jar
and when i looked inside i saw it held your heart
for me to walk away with
i began to understand why god died<div class="lyricbox">i heard you laughing in a crowd outside a <unk> we used to go to

but at least when you're at your worst
you know how to feel things

see when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

go ahead and steal my heart
to make me cry again
'cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
when we were both right
and no one had blame
but now i give up
on this endless game

'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my bones
even though everything's a strain
when night comes and i'm on my own
you should know i chose to be alone
so who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of...

no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up

and the driver inside it <unk> a new route to save the past
and checked his watch and grabbed a cab
a beautifully planned taxi cab
a <unk> had it cleared out back
and two men started to <unk>

driving once again
but now this time there were three men
and then i heard one of them say
"i know the night will turn to gray
i know the stars will start to fade
when all the darkness fades away
we had to steal him from his <unk>
so he could see another day

then i <unk> open my box
someone must have picked the lock
a little light <unk> the spot
where my <unk> had fought
then i pushed it open more,
pushing up against the door
then i sat up off the floor
and found the brother we're searching for

then there were three men up front
all i saw were backs of heads
and then i asked them am i alive and well or am i dreaming dead
and then one turned around to say,

it's better when something is wrong
you get excitement in your bones
and everything you do's a game
when night comes and you're on your own
you can say i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

who wants to be riding high
when you'll just crumble back on down
you give up everything you are
and even then you don't get far
they make believe that everything
is exactly what it seems
but at least when you're at your worst
you know how to feel things

see when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

go ahead and steal my heart
to make me cry again
'cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
when we were both right
and no one had blame
but now i give up
on this endless game

'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my bones
even though everything's a strain
when night comes and i'm on my own
you should know i chose to be alone
so who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of...

no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love<unk> streets and <unk>
you threw in the <unk> i broke your heart
but there's a first time for everything
who would've thought you'd feel so cold
and all these memories seem so old
to think you were my everything

remember when we'd talk all night
but time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

i got so much shit to say
but i can't help feeling like i'm camouflage
fortress around my heart
you were mine just yesterday
now i have no idea who you are
it's like you camouflage

but it's good to see you here again
i don't wanna say goodbye
but it's about half past ten
and i have to catch my ride

riding alone on the <unk>
and life's so <unk> it's like i could cry
if that's the last time i'd see you again
but i'll never tell you just how i felt
you might just not care, and it might just not help
what if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

remember when we'd talk all night
but time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

i got so much shit to say
but i can't help feeling like i'm camouflage
fortress around my heart

sorrow fills my eyes
but i'm not strong enough to cry
despite of my disguise
i'm left with no shoulder
but everybody wants to lean on me
i guess i'm their soldier
well, who's gonna be mine

who's there to save the hero
when she's left all alone
and she's crying out for help
who's there to save the hero
who's there to save the girl
after she saves the world

i bottle all my hurt inside
i guess i'm living a lie
inside my mind each day i die
what can bring me back to life?
a simple word, a <unk>

will lead to me, you taking <unk> off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i could've been a local <unk>
and you probably would've been worse off
so i'm a take this hat off, and i'm a hit it till i backs off
and then i'm back <unk>
cause you thinking you can <unk> what happen
you the reason i'm thinking i'm getting sick of rapping

[chorus]
<unk>
you probably think i walk around with my gun <unk> and
<unk> dick to these hoes like <unk>
well, you can think what you want but
i think you've been watching too much <unk> <unk>
you need to get real and check out my real life
i ain't a <unk> don't care what it smell like
but if you feel like putting all your <unk> aside
and talking to a real nigga, i'd gladly <unk>
first name <unk> i'd be <unk> to date ya
college <unk> got <unk> in papers
but i'm from the south where if you ain't <unk>
or rapping bout <unk> <unk> a freak of nature
such an <unk> speak so well
and talk so <unk> such an <unk>
contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
on behalf of them, i offer my apologies
maybe with me you'll <unk>
putting all niggas in a box of <unk>
me, cause i ain't dumb, shit i'm well <unk> like <unk>
and after me you'll never leave no stone <unk> uh, c'mon

[chorus]
<unk>
they say you never judge a book by it's cover
though you appear as <unk> just like the others
so i followed your words to take 'em in
and i don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
that's when i felt that i would need to
do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you
and try to get inside your head only
not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
so what i learned on my path to <unk>
your story took one ugly turn after another
i saw we wasn't on the same page
i would've gave you strong play but your words <unk> me the wrong way
so now i'm closing the case
you only out for the <unk> that's written all over your face
no el' will never judge a book by it's cover
until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[chorus]so girl
you just be honest with me, i know we can make this work
i love you

i know that you afraid, babe
but you don't need to be <unk> babe
you just need someone who understands
and i think i need the same, babe
show me where you at, let's keep it honest
home is where you at and that's a promise
open up and never keep it from us
nothing left between us, baby, nothing
tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
tell me who created you, i'd thank her
open up and never keep it from us
nothing left between us, baby

i hope that maybe this time it may be different
i told you i'mma make it happen, [?]

silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

i can't believe i fell for your <unk> i'm smarter than that
so dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
it took me some time but now i moved on
because i realized i got

that's what i found out
and there ain't no need to cry
i took a vow that from now on
i will be my own best friend

[repeat chorus]
so controlling to say that you love me but you don't
your family told me one day i would see it on my own
next thing i know i'm dealing with your three kids in my home
love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
took me some time but now i am strong

act like you know me, but you never will
one thing i know for sure

show you

got to learn things
learn them the hard way
got to see what it feels like

like flesh is all i got
not any more, flesh out the door, swat

i must've forgot, you can't trust me
i'm open a moment and close when you show it
before you know it i'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it
and the story unfolds
you should take my life
you should take my soul

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment
you know exactly where you're going
'cause the next moment, before you know it
time is slowing and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith

sometimes quiet is violent
i find it hard to hide it
my pride is no longer inside

it's on my sleeve
my skin will scream

inside my dream
i hate this car

i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear
oh dear, i don't know if we know why we're here
oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound

there are things we can do
but from the things that work, there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

and there's faith and there's sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake
and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think

i have these thoughts
so often i ought

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

should i leave it there?

even if it leads nowhere?

i build myself up and fly around in circles
waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be it?

i miss the air, i miss my friends

life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago

when i walk around all of the streets
where i grew up and found my feet
they can't look me in the eye
it's like they're scared of me
i try to think of things to say
like a joke or a memory
but they don't recognize me now
in the light of day

i know i'm not the only one
who regrets the things they've done
sometimes i just feel it's only me
who never became who they thought they'd be
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky, not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by

about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken, and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
did you know that i loved you or were you not aware?
you're the smile on my face
and i ain't going nowhere
i'm here to make you happy, i'm here to see you smile
i've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

well i can tell you're afraid of what this might do
cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
well i don't wanna lose it either
i don't think i can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
so take my hand
well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
cause i know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall
but if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your...
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

so fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall

if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fallwhen will i see you again?

of that <unk> baby
last night i did things i'm not proud of
and i got a little crazy
last night i met a guy on the dance floor
and i let him call me baby

and i don't even know his last name
my mama would be so ashamed
it started off, "hey cutie, where you from?"
and then it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know his last name

we left the club right around 3 o'clock
in the morning
his <unk> sitting there, in the parking lot
when it should have been a warning
i had no clue what i was getting into
so, i'll blame it on the cuervo
oh, where did my manners go?

and i don't even know his last name
my mama would be so ashamed
it started off, "hey cutie, where you from?"
and then it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know his last name
here we go!

today, i woke up
thinking about elvis somewhere in vegas
i'm not sure how i got here
or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
outta nowhere
i gotta go
take the chips and the <unk> and hit the road
they say what happens here, stays here
all of this will disappear
there's just one little <unk>

i don't even know my last name
my mama would be so ashamed
it started off, "hey cutie, where you from?"
and then it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know my last name

what have i done? what have i done? what have i done?
oh, what have i done?
i don't even know my last name
well it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know my last name
yeah, yeah, yeah...

it started off, "hey cutie, where you from?"
and then it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know my last name
oh yeahfor all the times that you <unk> on my <unk>
and all the clubs you get in using my name
you think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
you think i'm crying on my own, well i ain't

and i didn't wanna write a song 'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't but, you still hit my phone up
and baby i be movin' on and i think you should be somethin'
i don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

but when you told me that you hated my friends
the only problem was with you and not them
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
and tried to make me forget where i came from

and i didn't wanna write a song 'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't but, you still hit my phone up
and baby i be movin' on and i think you should be somethin'
i don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love, now i feel nothin' at all
had never felt so low when i was <unk>
was i a fool to let you break down my <unk>

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourselfi want to drive away
in the night, headlights call my name

i, i'll never be
be what you see inside
you say i'm not alone
but i am petrified
you say that you are close
is close the closest star?
you just feel twice as far

and i'll fall
and i'll break
and i'll fake
all i wanna

and i'll fall down
and i'll break down
and i'll fake you out
all i wanna

i'm so afraid
of what you have to say
'cause i am quiet now
and silence gives you space

i'll never be
be what you see inside
you say i'm not alone
but i am petrified
you say that you are close
is close the closest star?
you just feel twice as far

and i'll fall
and i'll break
and i'll fake
all i wanna

and i'll fall down
and i'll break down
and i'll fake you out

can't deny that i want you, but i'll lie if i have to
'cause you don't say you love me
to your friends, when they ask you
even though we both know that you do
you do

one time, been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
'cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

we all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
we know

you hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
to save you... instead they <unk>

don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i won't tell you
you don't care if you're true

don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i won't tell you
you don't care if you're true

[rihanna]
i know you've been hurt
by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do:
i'll take care of you...
i've loved and i've lostright under my feet, there's air made of bricks
pulls me down, turns me weak for you
i find myself repeating like a broken tune
and i'm forever excusing your intentions
and i give in to my pretendings
which forgive you each time
without me knowing
they melt my heart to stone

and i hear your words that i made up
you say my name like there could be an us
i best tidy up my head, i'm the only one in love
i'm the only one in love

each and every time i turn around to leave
i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
so desperately i try to link it with my head
but instead i fall back to my knees
as you tear your way right through me
i forgive you once again
without me knowing
you've burnt my heart to stone

and i hear your words that i made up
you say my name like there could be an us
i best tidy up my head, i'm the only one in love
i'm the only one in love

why do you steal my hand
whenever i'm standing my own ground?
you build me up, then leave me dead

well, i hear your words you made up
so i say your name like there should be an us
i best tidy up my head, i'm the only one in love
i'm the only one in love<unk> ting

and we're dying with every step we take
we're dying with every breath we make
and i'll fall in line

a <unk> back is all i see
he's only a few feet in front of me
and i'll look left and right sometimes
but i'll fall in line

no one looks up anymore
'cause you might get a <unk> in your eye
and heaven <unk> they see you cry
as we fall in line

and about this time every year
the line will go to the ocean <unk>
and walk right off into the sea
and then we fall asleep

and as we near the end of land
and our ocean <unk> are just beyond the sand
i ask myself the question
why i fall in line

then out of the corner of my eye
i see a spaceship in the sky
and hear a voice inside my <unk>
follow me instead

then the <unk> of war will start
inside my head with my counterpart
and the <unk> <unk> will <unk> the <unk>
this <unk> the only way

and then i start down the stand
my eyes are focused on the end of land
but again the voice inside my head says,
follow me instead

take me up, seal the door
i don't want to march here anymore
i realize that this line is dead
so i'll follow you instead

so then you put me back in my place
so i might start another day
and once again i will be
in a march to the sea[bun b - verse 1]

since the day they got married
he'd been praying for a little baby boy
someone he could take fishing
throw the football and be his pride and joy

he could already see him holding that <unk>
taking his team to state
but when the <unk> came in with a little pink blanket
all those big dreams changed

and now he's wrapped around her finger
she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little
beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-american girl

sixteen short years later
she was falling for the <unk> football star
before you knew it he was dropping <unk>
skipping practice just to spend more time with her

the coach said, "hey son, what's your <unk>
tell me, have you lost your <unk>
daddy said, <unk> lose your free ride to <unk>
boy, you better tell her <unk>

but now he's wrapped around her finger
she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little
beautiful, wonderful, perfect <unk>

and when they got married and decided to have one of their own
she said, "be honest, tell me what you <unk>
and he said, "honey, you oughta know...
sweet little beautiful, one just like you.
oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect <unk>

beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-american girl

will you buy me a house of gold?
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me?"

she asked me, "son, when i grow old

will you buy me a house of gold?
and when your father turns to stone
