and don't play cheap with your heart,

'cause i can be bought,
but you pay the cost,
if you can afford me</div>like a feather

when you give me that hummingbird heartbeat

that it's all just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not really there
i don't wanna be either
i wanna be, next to you
black and gold, black and gold, black and goldsix-feet-under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there's still a chance for you
'cause there's a spark in you

you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the fourth of july

'cause baby you're a firework
come on, show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go "ah, ah, ah!"
as you shoot across the sky

throw your bombs and your blows
but you're not gonna break my soul
this is the part of me
that you're never gonna ever take away from me, nojust one touch, now baby, i believe this is real
so take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
