then our love was interrupted by my schedule

there was nothing that i could do
'cause you fell into the deepest depression baby

then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

you got used to being alone, alone
you adapted, now you're used to being alone, all alone
oooh you got used to being on your own

when you meet the parents, you tell de niro
her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
next show they gotta up the zeros
nobody rocking like this 16 years old
the hard drums and the wally's something that caught me
i'm telling you what wu-tang taught me
the young youth, rocking the gold tooth
pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to cash rules
no question we the reason why the summer's blazing
then say, "you looking good fly coloured asian"
raw i give it to you, no trivia
she used to roll with my g-unit like olivia
until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
i guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine

justin bieber

and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,

forget about the way you love me.
forget about the world, we're set in stone.
i'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.

when we used to be just friends
protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank
that's where our hearts once save
and then we got closer
separated from my ex 'til we got closure
ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay

so get used to me checking in all day
get used to me falling through just to see your face
there in the moment i won't need your brace
get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
oh get used to it, hey
oh get used to it, oh it
oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it

at the table with the family, havin' dinner
blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
then i took a look to see before it activates the ringer
came to realize my homie bieber hit me on the twitter
then i hit him back despite i had some food up on my finger
sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla
bieber hit me back and said, "let's make it hot up in the winter."
i said, "cool." ya know imma deliver
let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
before we work i gotta get this off
see the other family members and drop gifts off
then i'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
you know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
people everywhere and all our twitter followerswell let me tell you a story
about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken, and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
did you know that i loved you or were you not aware?
you're the smile on my face
and i ain't going nowhere
i'm here to make you happy, i'm here to see you smile
i've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

well i can tell you're afraid of what this might do
cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
well i don't wanna lose it either
i don't think i can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
so take my hand
well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
cause i know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall
but if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your...
you can't fly unless you let yourself fallnow romeo and juliet
bet they never felt the way we felt
bonnie and clyde
never had to hide like we do, we do
you and i both know it can't work
it's all fun and games
'til someone gets hurt
and i don't, i won't let that be you

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two, who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space
'cause i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam and eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny and cher
i don't care, i've got you baby
see we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
we are both too foolish to stop

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two, who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
and i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment

must be the night, the ghost of a life
all of the memories
a serenity dwindling my mind
all the time

like a permanent stain
wishing i could just wash away, away
prayed our love wasn't vain
who was to blame for all the pain? for all the pain?
oh oh

i never thought that it'd be easy
'cause we're both so distant now
and the walls are closing in on us
and we're wondering how
no one has a solid answer
but just walking in the dark
and you can see the look on my face
it just tears me apart

through the hurt
and we cry and cry and cry and cry

ludacris
luda! when i was 13, i had my first love,
there was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us or could ever come above
she had me going crazy, oh, i was star-struck,ended up on a crossroad
try to figure out which way to go
it's like you're stuck on a treadmill
running in the same place
you got your hazard lights on now
hoping that somebody would slow down
praying for a miracle
who'll show you grace?
had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
with a long journey ahead
seen a truck pull over
god sent an angel to help you out
he gave you direction
showed you how to read a map
with a long journey ahead
said it ain't over
oh, even in the midst of doubt

life is worth living
life is worth living, so live another day
the meaning of forgiveness
people make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
life is worth living again

relationship on a ski slope
avalanche comin' down slow
do we have enough time to salvage this love?
feels like a blizzard in april
'cause my heart is just that cold
skating on thin ice
but it's strong enough to hold us up
seen her scream and holler
put us both on blast
tearing each other down
when i thought it was over
god sent us an angel to help us out
he gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
for that long journey ahead
said it ain't ever over
oh, even in the midst of doubt

life is worth living
life is worth living, so live another dayalright let's go
