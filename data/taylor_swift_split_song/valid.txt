loving him is like
driving a new maserati down a dead end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin
ending so suddenly

loving him is like
trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn
so bright, just before they lose it all

losing him was blue like i've never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
but loving him was red,loving him was red

touching him was like
realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like
wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

losing him was blue like i've never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
but loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head,in burning red
burning, it was red

losing him was blue like i'd ever known
missing him was dark gray, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
comes back to me, burning red
his love was like
driving a new maserati down a dead end streetnice to meet you, where you been?
i could show you incredible things
magic, madness, heaven, sins
saw you there and i thought

"oh my god, look at that face!"
you look like my next mistake
love's a game, wanna play?

new money, suit and tie
i can read you like a magazine
ain't it funny, rumors fly
and i know you heard about me

so hey, let's be friends
i'm dying to see how this one ends
grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (mmm)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game

'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

cherry lips, crystal skies
i could show you incredible things
stolen kisses, pretty lies
you're the king, baby, i'm your queen

find out what you want
be that girl for a month
wait, the worst is yet to come
oh no

screaming, crying, perfect storms
i can make all the tables turn
rose garden filled with thorns
keep you second-guessing like

"oh my god, who is she?"
i get drunk on jealousy
but you'll come back each time you leave
'cause darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (mmm)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game

'cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (over)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game

'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far (ooh)
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your namei could go back,
to every laugh,
but, i don't want to go there anymore
and i know all the steps,
up to your door
but, i don't wanna go there anymore

talk to the wind
talk to the sky
talk to the man with the reasons why,
and let me know what you find

i'll leave my window open,
'cause i'm too tired tonight to call your name
just know i'm right here hopin'
that you'll come in with the rain

i could stand up,
and sing you a song
but, i don't want to have to go that far
and i, i got you down
i know you by heart,
and you don't even know where i start

talk to yourself
talk to the tears
talk to the man who put you here,
and don't wait for the sky to clear

i'll leave my window open,
'cause i'm too tired tonight to call your name
just know i'm right here hopin'
that you'll come in with the rain

i've watched you so long,
screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say

but, i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired tonight for all these games
just know i'm right here hopin'
that you'll come in with the rain

i could go back,
to every laugh,
but, i don't want to go there anymorestate the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine, i'll tell mine you're gay
by the way...

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

there's no time for tears
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

and if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard, i really really hate that...

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

burn, burn, burn, baby burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby, burn...one look, dark room
meant just for you
time moved too fast
you play it back

buttons on a coat
lighthearted joke
no proof, not much
but you saw enough

small talk, he drives
coffee at midnight
blue light reflects
the chain on your neck

he says look up
and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch
but you felt enough

you can hear it in the silence, silence, you
you can feel it on the way home, way home, you
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love, you are in love

morning, his place
burnt toast, sunday
you keep his shirt
he keeps his word

and for once you let go
of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much
but it said enough

you kiss on sidewalks
you fight and you talk
one night he wakes
strange look on his face

pauses, then says
"you're my best friend."
and you knew what it was
he is in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence, you
you can feel it on the way home, way home, you
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love

and so it goes
you two are dancing
in a snow globe round your neck
and he keeps the picture
of you in his office downtown

and you understand now why they
lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life
tryin' to put it into words

'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence, you
you can feel it on the way home, way home, you
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love, you are in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence, you
you can feel it on the way home, way home, you
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love, you are in lovei stay out too late
got nothin' in my brain
that's what people say, mmh-hmm

i go on too many dates (heh-heh)
but i can't make 'em stay
at least that's what people say, mmh-hmm
that's what people say, mmh-hmm

but i keep cruisin'
can't stop, won't stop movin'
it's like i got this music
in my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"

'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off (whoo)

heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off (whoo)

i never miss a beat, ah

i'm dancin' on my own (dancin' on my own)
i'll make the moves up as i go (moves up as i go)
and that's what they don't know, mmh-hmm
that's what they don't know, mmh-hmm

but i keep cruisin'
can't stop, won't stop groovin'
it's like i got this music
in my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"

'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off (whoo)

hey, hey, hey
just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
you could've been getting down to this sick beat

my ex-man brought his new girlfriend
she's like, "oh my god"
but i'm just gonna shake

i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off
i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off (whoo)friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world
tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
the secrets all my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself
only you can see

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me, who i wanna be
well, i'm only me when i'm with you
with youi'm walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same

you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone, just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

so you were never a saint
and i've loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild

and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same

this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles' heel
this is the golden age of something good and right and real

and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same

i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same

this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and rightstate the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy

baby, burn...<div class="lyricbox">i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and, lord, it took me away
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

took off faster than a green light, go
hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke made
and that was the first day

and, darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of "i need you."
and for the first time i had something to lose

and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the got dust on every page
sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd

'cause, darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

tonight gonna dance for all that been through
but i wanna dance if not dancing with you
tonight gonna dance like you were in this room

it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

tonight gonna dance for all that been through
but i wanna dance if not dancing with you
tonight gonna dance like you were in this room
but i wanna dance if not dancing with you</div>i don't know what i want,
so, don't ask me,
'cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road
i'm just walking,
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one,
who feels the way i do

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl,
trying to find a place in this world

got the radio on
my old blue jeans,
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today,
got the sunshine,
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery,
oh yeah, but, that's okay

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl,
trying to find a place in this world

maybe i'm just a girl,
on a mission
but, i'm ready to fly

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on

oh, i'm alone,
on my own
and that's all i know
oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

oh, i'm just a girli didn't know,
what i would find,
when i went lookin' for a reason
i know,
i didn't read,
between the lines,
and baby i've got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right?

so how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

you saw me there,
but never knew
that i would give it all just to be
a part of this,
a part of you
and now it's all too late
so you see,
you could have helped if you had wanted to
but, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

so how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

oh, yeah
how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

oh oh
ah, oh ohi like the way you sound in the morning
we're on the phone and without a warning
i realize your laugh is the best sound i have ever heard
i like the way i can't keep my focus
i watch you talk, you didn't notice
i hear the words but all i can think is we should be together

every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine for you

whoa, i'm feeling you baby
don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
baby, i'm never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
'cause i'm gonna stay through it all
so jump then fall

well, i like the way your hair falls in your face
you got the keys to me, i love each freckle on your face
oh, i've never been so wrapped up, honey
i like the way you're everything i've ever wanted
i had time to think it over and all i can say is come closer
take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'cause every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine for you

whoa, i'm feeling you baby
don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
baby, i'm never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
'cause i'm gonna stay through it all
so jump then fall

the bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
i'll catch you, i'll catch you
when people say things that bring you to your knees
i'll catch you
the time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
but i'll hold you through the night until you smile

whoa, i need you baby
don't be afraid, please jump then fall, jump then fall into me
baby, i'm never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
'cause i'ma stay through it all
so jump then fall

jump then fall, baby
jump then fall into me, into me

every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i'll shine
and every time you're here, baby
i'll show you, i'll show you you can

jump then fall, jump then fall
jump then fall into me, into me, yeahoh baby give me one more chance
(i'll show you that i love you)
i want you please let me,
back in your heart

oh darling i was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
now that i see you in her arms

i want you back

i want you back, ohh baby
i want you back

ohh woah-oh
oh baby give me one more chance
(i'll show you that i love you)
i want you please let me,
back in your heart
oh darling i was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
now that i see you in her armslong were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
my mother accused me of losing my mind, but i swore i was fine

you paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
when i lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
wondering which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well, i stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

dear john
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i should've known

well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
and i'll look back and regret, i ignored when they said run as fast as you can

dear john
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home

dear john
i see it all now, it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young
to be played by your dark, twisted games?
when i loved you so
i should've known

you are an expert at sorry!
and keeping lines blurry
never impressed
by me acing your tests
all the girls that you run dry
have tired lifeless eyes
'cause you burned them out
but i took your matches
before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks
over your sad, empty town

dear john
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home

i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you should've known

don't you think i was too young?
you should've knownyou were in college working part-time waiting tables
left a small town, never looked back
i was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

i say, "can you believe it?"
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i can see it
yes, yes
i can see it now

do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes, yes
this is what i thought about

do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

and i remember that fight, 2:30 am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

braced myself for the goodbye
'cause that's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said i'll never leave you alone

you said
i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine

hold on
make it last
never turn back

you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
you are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(oh yeah)
yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
yes, yes, i can see it (come on, come on)
i can see it nowtall, dark, and superman
he puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say, yeah

and you'll smile and say, how are you?
i'll say just fine
i always forget to tell you i love you
i'll love you forever

i watched superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watched superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

tall, dark, and beautiful
he's complicated, he's irrational
but i hope someday he'll take me away
and save the day, yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they said

and you'll leave, got places to be
and i'll be okay
i always forget to tell you i love you
i loved you from the very first day

i watched superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watched superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you don't save some other girl
don't forget, don't forget about me
i'm far away, but i never let you go
i'm love struck, and looking out the window
don't forget, don't forget where i'll be

right here wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the car was from you
'cause i loved you from the very first day

i watched superman fly away

and i don't think we can solve 'em
you made a really deep cut
and baby, now we got bad blood, hey

did you have to do this?
i was thinking that you could be trusted
did you have to ruin
what was shining? now it's all rusted

did you have to hit me?
where i'm weak, baby, i couldn't breathe
and rub it in so deep
salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

oh, it's so sad to
think about the good times
you and i

still got scars on my back from your knife
so don't think it's in the past
these kind of wounds, they last and they last

now did you think it all through?
all these things will catch up to you
and time can heal but this won't
so if you're coming my way, just don't

'cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

now we got problems
and i don't think we can solve 'em
you made a really deep cut
and baby, now we got bad blood, heyi still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
the words that you whispered, for just us to know
you told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

if i do recall now, the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement, i ran off the plane
that july ninth, the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt, i can still feel your arms

but now i'll go
sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss

i never thought we'd have our last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

i do remember the swing in your step
the life of the party, you're showing off again
and i'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
i'm not much for dancing, but for you i did

because i love your handshake, meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions

and now i'll go
sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss

i never thought we'd have our last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

so i'll watch your life in pictures
like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me
like i used to feel you breathe
and i'll keep up with our old friends
just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are

and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind

so i'll go
sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss

i never thought we'd have our last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
just like our lasti said, "remember this moment"
in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild

we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew
our lives would never be the same

you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age

long live
the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you

i was screaming, long live
all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day
we will be remembered

i said, "remember this feeling?"
i passed the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
wishing for right now

we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town

and the cynics were outraged
screaming, "this is absurd!"
'cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
got to rule the world

long live
the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you

i was screaming, long live
all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid

long live
all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you

i was screaming, long live
that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day
we will be remembered

hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall

can you take a moment
promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if, god forbid, fate should step in

and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name

tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine

long live
the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life
with you

long, long live
the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you

and i was screaming, long live
all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid

singing, long live
all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you

and long, long live
that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day
we will be rememberedyou said it in a simple way
four a.m., the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss then you catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall
i told myself, "don't get attached."
but in my mind i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you

and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here

the delicate, beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can't put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've played so nonchalant
taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you

and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here

this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away

in new york, be here
but you're in london
and i break down
this is not fair
that you're not around

and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here

i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be herenice to meet you, where you been?
i could show you incredible things
magic, madness, heaven, sins
saw you there and i thought

"oh my god, look at that face!"
you look like my next mistake
love's a game, wanna play?

new money, suit and tie
i can read you like a magazine
ain't it funny, rumors fly
and i know you heard about me

so hey, let's be friends
i'm dying to see how this one ends
grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (mmm)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game

'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

cherry lips, crystal skies
i could show you incredible things
stolen kisses, pretty lies
you're the king, baby, i'm your queen

find out what you want
be that girl for a month
wait, the worst is yet to come
oh no

screaming, crying, perfect storms
i can make all the tables turn
rose garden filled with thorns
keep you second-guessing like

"oh my god, who is she?"
i get drunk on jealousy
but you'll come back each time you leave
'cause darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (mmm)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game

'cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name

boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya

so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over (over)
if the high was worth the pain

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game

'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far (ooh)
it'll leave you breathless (mmm)
or with a nasty scar

got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your nameshe said "i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shine
in the sky
the pretty lights
and our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love
and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes
and said "oh, my, my, my"

took me back to the house and the backyard trees
said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did
took me back when the world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids
you and i
oh, my, my, my

well i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined
like pretty lights
and our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes,
and said "oh, my, my, my"

took me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. running in your truck
and all i need is you next to me
took me back to the time we had our very first fight
slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside
'till the morning light
oh, my, my, my

a few years have gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
and you looked at me
got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came
and our mamas cried
you said "i do"
and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on the very front porch
after all this time
you and i

i'll be eighty seven
you'll be eighty nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky
oh, my, my, myelevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now, my time is theirs

seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out, but my choice is you

so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care, 'cause right now you're mine

and you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
and i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'cause my heart is yours

so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard

so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high, the waters rough
but this love is ourswalking through a crowd, the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted something more
searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

and it said "welcome to new york"
it's been waiting for you
welcome to new york

it's been waiting for you

it's a new soundtrack
i could dance to this beat
beat, forevermore
the lights are so bright
but they never blind me, me

welcome to new york
it's been waiting for you

when we first dropped out bags on apartment floors
took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
everybody here was someone else before
and you can want who you want: boys and boys and girls and girls

welcome to new york
it's been waiting for you

it's been waiting for you

it's a new soundtrack
i could dance to this beat
beat, forevermore
the lights are so bright
but they never blind me, me

welcome to new york (new york)
it's been waiting for you
welcome to new york

like any great love
it keeps you guessing
like any real love
it's ever changing
like any true love
it drives you crazy
but you know you wouldn't change
anything, anything, anything

welcome to new york
it's been waiting for you

it's been waiting for you

it's a new soundtrack
i could dance to this beat
the lights are so bright
but they never blind me

(welcome to new york)
new soundtrack, it's been waiting for you
the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
so bright they never blind me

welcome to new yorkdrew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing, everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see<div class="lyricbox">took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turned the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song
but i do, i do

walked in expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pulled my chair out and helped me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do

and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a i watched it begin again

you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy
but i do

but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a i watched it begin again

and we walk down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
for the first time, what's past is past

'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a i watched it begin again
but on a wednesday in a i watched it begin again</div>he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and it's like
i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine

but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you

he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable

but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you

he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating, intoxicating
complicated, got away by some mistake and now

i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
i'm so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you oh, oh

never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
