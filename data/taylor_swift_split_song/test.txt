drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing, everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't seeyou, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like i'm nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when i'm wounded
you, pickin' on the weaker man

you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know

someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
why you gotta be so mean?

you, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
you, have pointed out my flaws again as if i don't already see them
i'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again

i'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know

someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
why you gotta be so mean?

and i can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing

but all you are is mean
all you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

but someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

someday, i'll be, living in a big old city
(why you gotta be so mean?)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on the balcony in summer air

see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, "hello."
little did i know

that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet!"
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, "please don't go!"
and i said

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes."

so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while
oh, oh

'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet!"
but you were everything to me
i was begging you, "please don't go!"
and i said

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes."

romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult, but it's real
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes."

oh, oh
i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town
and i said

romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head, i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you, and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes."

oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

'cause we were both young when i first saw youpeople like you always want back
the love they gave away
and people like me wanna believe you
when you say you've changed

the more i think about it now
the less i know
all i know is that you drove us
off the road

(stay) hey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then, why you had to go and lock me out
while i let you in?

(stay) hey, now you say you want it
back now that it's just too late
well could've been easy
all you had to do was (stay)


here you are now, calling me up
but i don't know what to say
i've been picking up the pieces
of the mess you made

people like you always want back
the love they pushed aside
but people like me are gone forever
when you say goodbye

(stay) hey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then, why you had to go and lock me out
while i let you in?

(stay) hey, now you say you want it
back now that it's just too late
well could've been easy
all you had to do was (stay)


let me remind you this was what you wanted
you're in the air
you were all i wanted
but not like this

not like this
oh, all you had to do was (stay)

hey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then, why you had to go and lock me out
while i let you in?

(stay) hey, now you say you want it
back now that it's just too late
well could've been easy
all you had to do was (stay)

hey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then, why you had to go and lock me out
while i let you in?

(stay) hey, now you say you want it
back now that it's just too late
well could've been easy
all you had to do was (stay)

all you had to do was (stay)
all you had to do was (stay)<div class="lyricbox">and a sad picture, the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know all the same, another time and place
repeating history and getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and do anything to see it through

because these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
we sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

so been outnumbered
raided and now cornered
hard to fight when the fight fair
getting stronger now
find things they never found
they might be bigger
but faster and never scared
you can walk away, say we need this
but something in your eyes
says we can beat this

because these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
we sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

tonight we stand, get off our knees
fight for what worked for all these years
and the battle was long, the fight of our lives
but stand up champions tonight

it was the night things changed
do you see it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
a revolution, throw your hands up
cause we never gave in
and we sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
hallelujah</div>the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless that you send me running but i
kind of know that i won't get far.

and you stood there in front of me just
close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see
what i was thinking of

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

get me with those green eyes, baby
as the lights go down
something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

my mind forgets to remind me
that you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really something
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be

i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you, i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently but
i really wish you would

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause i see, sparks fly whenever you smile

get me with those green eyes, baby
as the lights go down
something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause i see, sparks fly whenever you smile

i run my fingers through your hair
and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me
it's just strong enough to make you feel right
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow
i'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

get me with those green eyes, baby
as the lights go down
something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause i see, sparks fly whenever you smilei'm five years old
its getting cold out, got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you
i run and run, past the pumpkin patch, and the tractor rides
look now, the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

i dont know why all the trees change in the fall
i know youre not scared of anything at all
dont know if snow whites house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today

i'm thirteen now
and dont know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop til i forgot all their names

i dont know who i'm gonna talk to now at school
but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
dont know how long its gonna take to feel ok
but i know i had the best day with you today

i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out hes better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house
and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you

there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
staying back and watching me shine
and i didnt know if you knew so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you todaywe're all bored
we're all so tired of everything
we wait for
trains that just aren't coming
we show off
our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better

we're so young
but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb
but we know exactly what we're doin'
we cry tears
of mascara in the bathroom
honey, life is just a classroom

'cause baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly

we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free

we're all here
the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back
it's all in the timing
it's poker
he can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace

we need love
but all we want is danger
we team up
then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors
are terrible and cruel
but honey, most of them are true (ah)

'cause baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly

we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free

so come on, come along with me
the best people in life are free

please take my hand and
please take me dancing and
please leave me stranded
it's so romantic (it's so romantic)

'cause baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

'cause baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly

we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are freei took a chance, i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
you took a swing, i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are

i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around

and here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why

you could write a book on
how to ruin someone's perfect day
well, i get so confused and frustrated
forget what i'm trying to say

i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me, then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around

and here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why

why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside?
why do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind?

and i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me, then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around

here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why, why, tell me why

i take a step back, and let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof, now you knowthere's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot, yeah

we're drivin' down the road, i wonder if you know
i'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly makin' me want you

and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

so baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
in this one horse town, i wanna stay right here
in this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
in this moment, now capture it, remember it

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake, i'm not usually this way
but you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
it's fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearlessall this time i was wasting
hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time
and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long
baby, but i've figured you out
and you thinking we'll be fine again
but not this time around

you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't want to hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby
like i did before
you're not sorry, no, no, no, no

looking so innocent
i might believe you if i didn't know
could have loved you all my life
if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
and you've got your share of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know
and now you're asking me to listen
'cause it's worked each time before

but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't want to hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby
like i did before
you're not sorry, no, no

you had me crawling for you, honey
and it never would have gone away, no
you used to shine so bright
but i watched all of it fade

so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there's nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby
like i did before
you're not sorry, no, no(i, i, i, i) i

you stand with your hand on my waistline
it's a scene and we're out in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as they pass by
it's a bad sign, bad sign

something happens when everybody finds out
see the vulture circling dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
it could burn out

'cause they got the cages
they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters
we are the foxes and we run

baby
i know places we won't be found
and they'll be
chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'cause i, i know places
we can hide, i know places
i know places

lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want, we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time

just grab my hand
and don't ever drop it, my love
they are the hunters
we are the foxes and we run

baby
i know places we won't be found
and they'll be
chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'cause i, i know places
we can hide, i know places

they are the hunters
we are the foxes and we run
just grab my hand
and don't ever drop it, my love

baby
i know places we won't be found
and they'll be
chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'cause i, i know places
we can hide, i know places

they take their shots, we're bulletproof
(i know places)
and you know for me it's always you
and you're dead at night, your eyes so grey
and i know for you it's always me

(i, i, i, i) ii used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say, "they're the lucky ones"
i used to know my place was the spot next to you
now i'm searching the room for an empty seat
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on

oh, a simple complication,
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up, i can't break through

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing you
like it's killing me, yeah
i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now

next chapter!
how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
and you're doing your best to avoid me
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride, like you should've held me

oh, i'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothing?
i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how
i've never heard silence quite this loud

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing you
like it's killing me, yeah
i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now

this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you say you'd rather love than fight

so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing you
like it's killing me, yeah
but i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know, is it killing you
like it's killing me, yeah
i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate
'cause we're going down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now

the end.what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings

business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here

you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives

and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure

she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor
like i do

i'm in my room, it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story
like i do

but she wears short skirts, i wear t-shirts
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see
you belong with me?
you belong with me

walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
i can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
hey, isn't this easy?

and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine, i know you better than that
hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

she wears high heels, i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you
see
you belong with me?

standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
all this time, how could you not know
baby, you belong with me
you belong with me

oh i remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong, think i know it's with me

can't you see that i'm the one who understands you?
been here all along, so why can't you
see
you belong with me?

standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
all this time, how could you not know
baby
you belong with me, you belong with me

you belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
you belong with me, you belong with me
