she never mess with entertainers 'cuz they always leave
she said it feel like you walked and drove on me

i guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
she said ye, keep makin that platinum and gold for me
but if you really cared for her
then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams

it's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here

so i'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there, i don't trust these hoes at all
but that's just the <unk> of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple porn stars that i'm ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna my only role models
<unk> and jordan my only role models
that's why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
bottom sixes and chains, and some <unk> and rings
all of the little <unk> that make me a king
i never hear the <unk> they try and point out to me
but it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
i'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about christmas in <unk>
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some shake, a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs. <unk> they're making the cookie stretch
i know it so well, i know the hustle so well

lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
with my new bitch that's living in palm <unk>
young ass nigga, <unk> dreams

i wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
in a time where it's <unk>
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween <unk>
i know of all the things that i hear they be <unk> fun at
never the flow though, they know i run that
fuck you all, i claim that whenever
i change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
<unk> i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne at forever
i'm a <unk> of either marley or <unk>
i haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
i'm hearing all of the <unk> i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin' emotion don't ever mean i'm a pussy
know that i don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or <unk> me
lord knows, lord knows, i'm heavy, i got my weight up
<unk> boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me, then who should i be afraid <unk>
bought a white ghost, now shit is gettin' <unk>

we all fall <unk>

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his <unk>
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter

i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an <unk>
i need to be the <unk> my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever just pop off, i'm supposed to be beside 'em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy, this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit

and even though the battle was won, i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it, <unk> i'm <unk>
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for, it's not why i got in it

that was never my <unk> for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped <unk>
it wasn't my <unk> my intentions was good
i went through my whole career without ever <unk> it

now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
so i did, i just fell back, watched and <unk> my teeth

while he's all over tv down talkin' a man
who literally saved my life, like "fuck it, i <unk>
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's <unk> 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets <unk> it ain't just words no more is it?

it's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

until ja started <unk> in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some <unk> at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an <unk> for me and thinks that i'll be his <unk>
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that <unk> the same one that made me famous

now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
when i'm so busy being pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just <unk> 50's beef with murder <unk>

and he's <unk> mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to <unk> us, strictly to show they support us

we'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have <unk> avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it, i can't think of a <unk> way to word it
than to just say that i love ya'll too much to see the <unk>
i'll walk away from it all before i let it go any further

but don't get it twisted, it's not a <unk> that i'm coppin'
i'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
off at your jaws with the <unk> 'cause <unk> i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers(chorus)

eminem impersonating mr. mackey &amp; eric cartman :
okay children, quiet down, quiet down
children, i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr. shady
children, quiet down please
<unk> don't throw that (shut up)
mr. shady will be your new substitute while mr. kaniff is out with <unk> (he's got <unk>
good luck mr. shady

hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)
today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob (hi <unk> <unk> 30 and still lives with his mom
he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and <unk> pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for <unk> off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the <unk> block

and even if they <unk> and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
till one night mrs. stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block, uh
you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to <unk> they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (come on)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad <unk> your hand)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
and there's really nothing else to say (sing <unk>
drugs are just bad, m'kay

my penis is the size of a <unk> have you seen it
fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
speaking of <unk> you know what else is bad for squirrels
<unk> it's the worst drug in the world

if someone ever <unk> it to you, don't do it
kids, two <unk> probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is <unk> you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

meet <unk> 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a <unk> party, he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's <unk> by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

<unk> he starts to <unk> and his <unk>
goes into <unk> and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up, looks like the <unk> arches
he's on <unk> <unk> layin' <unk> <unk>

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey <unk> <unk> is a <unk> look at <unk>
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile <unk> in a <unk> the action is over
and his back and his shoulders <unk> up like he's practicing <unk>
and that's the story of <unk> the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (that's right)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs <unk> <unk>
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
and there's really nothing else to say (uh huh)
drugs are just bad, m'kay

and last but not <unk> one of the most <unk>
problems among young people today, is <unk>
it grows from cow <unk> they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it <unk> <unk>

and then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything <unk> down when you eat some of 'em
and sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
like fat women in <unk> with orange hair

"mr. shady, what's a <unk> it's <unk> <unk>
women stick them up their <unk> go out and wear 'em
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms, i meant <unk>

your tongue <unk> all <unk> up like a cow's tongue (how <unk>
'cause it comes from a cow's <unk>
see drugs are bad, it's a common fact
but your mom and dad, know that's all that i'm good at

but don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and od
they're gonna come for me, and i'ma have to grow a <unk>
and get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
so don't drugs and do exactly as i don't, because i'm bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (uh huh)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can <unk>
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will)

so kids say no to drugs (say no)
so you don't act like everyone else does (like i do)

drugs are just bad, m'kay

eminem impersonating mr. mackey &amp; eric cartman :

taught you what coming into the family and respect is all <unk> so the first thing you gotta learn is the name respect, tha means you dont cross nobody you dont go over the line, once you go over that line theres no coming back whether youre a <unk> of the family or <unk> thats when people get <unk> and we dont want nobody <unk> in our family so i gotta teach you the proper way of <unk> when youre <unk> money, everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> its all about cash money thats what its all about making the money. so the first thing of business is this, you remember your name, you dont <unk> your <unk> you never ever disrespect anyone thats above you especially your <unk> especially the big time guys, those are the guys you listen <unk> you never ever disrespect anyone unless your told to unless you get the <unk> and if there is no sit down theres nothingi'm <unk> tonight you know that shit gon' be packed

it makes me feel like, superman
can you fly, i can, wanna see

i'm only entertaining you, my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i, to a place that you can't see
but i believe you can fly

i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me, entertain you

my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to <unk> attacks with constant <unk>
when lyrics constantly took out of <unk>

<unk> to <unk> with <unk>
<unk> been a problem for the longest i guess
but, maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought, see how long it takes to <unk>

feeling good when i should be ashamed
shit i really should've fell but i stood
see i came like a flame in the night
like a ghost in the dark

there's a ray
there's a light
there's a hope
there's a spark

but when <unk> <unk>
they'll never see eye to eye
until they decide
to set their <unk> aside

and this is why
only one of us will survive
so children follow my lead
and feel the vibe because

i'm only entertaining you, my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i, to a place that you can't see
but i believe you can fly

i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me, entertain you

my, music can be <unk> <unk>
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
trying to separate the truth from entertainment
it's stupid ain't it, i get sick of trying to explain it

see i can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
just being a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> blonde
'cause i came here to <unk> let your woes be gone
tell em' to get fucked and just <unk> on

constantly <unk> constantly using the <unk>
as a form of <unk>
bless the children, nothing less than <unk>
let me entertain you like <unk> williams

i'll be here when y'all are gone <unk>
world <unk> still <unk> still slim
how many kids will <unk> probably millions
but i'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then cause

i'm only entertaining you, my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i, to a place that you can't see
but i believe you can fly

i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me, entertain you

my, lyrical content <unk> subject matter
that <unk> up all these fucked up young kids at an
<unk> <unk> common <unk>
add it up and you'll see that's why i <unk>

i try to <unk> but kids <unk>
and <unk> every move you <unk> slim you're great
but wait, can't you see i'm only here to entertain
i gotta be the one to go against the grain

'cause man, i see it, feel it, live it but it's <unk>
for me to see you be <unk> and pretend you ain't
but they don't understand that i've been through pain
if you get to know me i can be a friend you gain

but you can't just stand there and try to judge
it hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and it's such a pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every <unk> that i <unk> in my lust, but

i'm only entertaining you, my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i, to a place that you can't see
but i believe you can fly

i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me, entertain you<unk>

rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live

liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
when it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said high
till the next time i see her on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like us, talked like us
his back against the wall nigga fought like us
damn poor <unk> that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
what's his father name <unk> never knew him though he had his blood in em
hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
<unk> <unk> herself she wish she could have saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him could save him
he put his faith in the 38 in his waist
but when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before 38 and a
that's the life of what's raised by a winter, it's a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
<unk> life just ended on that <unk> day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed down at the city <unk>
open the drawer saw em <unk>
her addiction grew
prescription drugs dipped in brew
angel dust dipped in whoo
she slipped into her own <unk> world
had her self pregnant by different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasn't really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when the moon was full and the stars was just right
and the dress was real tight
and it sounded like lisa lisa i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hard head from around the way that she wanted all her life
shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when they <unk> on the bike
he was a willie all her life
he wasn't really the one to like
it was a dude named <unk>
who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but <unk> liked this broad way life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red, green and, white
hanging out the window when she first seen em fight
so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight
that would turn it to a homicide that would alter their life
see mike at 32 was still on the seen
he had a son 15 that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an <unk> but he <unk> him
like if that was my son he would look much different
see i'm light <unk> and that baby there's dark
so it's momma's baby <unk> maybe
mike was still crazy out there running the streets
had his old <unk> 38 gun in his reach
he spent <unk> years him and <unk> aint speak
he runnin around like life is a <unk>
till one day he approached this thug
that had a mean mug
and he looked so familiar that he called um young cuz
told em get off the strip but the boy aint budge
instead he pulled out a <unk> 38 <unk>
he <unk> had to drop but the boy just <unk>
it was something in this mans face he knew he seen before
it's like looking in the mirror seeing his self more <unk>
he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who <unk> at war
(what's that) he who <unk> is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank

<unk> road flows, i did this shit for my nigga <unk>
back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for <unk>
then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he was <unk> doin' <unk> out of your basement
he let us hit the weed on <unk> for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
feel like i never say much but man there's a lot to know
feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
i'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
i mean you boys not even coming close
i gave niggas like you a reason for <unk>
you number one and i'm eddie <unk> we <unk> places
lookin' in the mirror i'm closer than i really appear
creepin' like <unk> without the <unk> love, and care
no tender love and care and no love and <unk>
i got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
i might be here as a <unk> to teach people the lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
yeah, but here we are and it's a new <unk>
40 the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
a lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
your best day is my worst day, i get green like earth day
you treat me like i'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
you don't be <unk> perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
you platinum like rappers on <unk> boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was <unk>
and then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and did it with a purpose
used to have secret <unk> to <unk> my <unk>

okay children, quiet down, quiet down
children, i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day

<unk> don't throw that (shut up)
mr. shady will be your new substitute while mr. kaniff is out with <unk> (he's got <unk>
good luck mr. shady

hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)

but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob (hi <unk> <unk> 30 and still lives with his mom
he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and <unk> pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for <unk> off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the <unk> block

and even if they <unk> and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
till one night mrs. stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block, uh
you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to <unk> they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey <unk> <unk> is a <unk> look at <unk>
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile <unk> in a <unk> the action is over
and his back and his shoulders <unk> up like he's practicing <unk>
and that's the story of <unk> the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

at no <unk> direction just <unk> and <unk>
straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

<unk> <unk> from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

leavin' with a taste as sour as <unk> in their mouth
see they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
look at me now, i bet ya probably sick of me now
ain't you, mama? imma make you look so ridiculous now

i'm sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

i said, i'm sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

i got some skeletons in my closet and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
i'll take you back to <unk>
before i ever had a <unk> sellin' cd

i was a baby, maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'cause he split, i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't owe him a second thought, i just fuckin' wished he would die

i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim, i'd <unk> my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake, i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only <unk> but i'm man enough to face 'em today

what i did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
but the <unk> shit i did was take the bullets outta that gun
'cause i'd have killed 'em, shit, i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show

i'm sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

but put yourself in my position, just try to envision
<unk> your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

<unk> that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'

my whole life i was made to believe i was sick, when i wasn't
till i grew up, now i blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me, ma?
so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
but guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
and <unk> growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

and hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
but you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

but how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch, i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when <unk> died and you said you wished it was me?
well guess <unk> i am dead - dead to you as can <unk>

i'm sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

whose worst fear is a child with <unk> hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no <unk>
it's so scary in a house that <unk> no swearing

to see him walking around with his headphones <unk>
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
he's a problem child and what <unk> him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
but if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are <unk> he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

he <unk> his pants, <unk> and a <unk> cap
his <unk> hit him so he <unk> him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(chorus from <unk> dream on)
(come on!) sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing it!)
for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is <unk> <unk> with gangstas
in the land of the killers, a <unk> mind is a <unk>
holy or <unk> only have one homie
only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

yet everybody just feels like they can relate
i guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can <unk> or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single <unk> we make

like they <unk> us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this <unk> happen
from standin' on corners and <unk> just rappin'
to havin' a <unk> no more kissin' ass

but then these critics <unk> you, <unk> try to burn you
fans turn on you, <unk> all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad

so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any <unk> won't hesitate to produce <unk>
that's why these <unk> wanna <unk> me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

but all they kids be listenin' to me <unk>
so i'm <unk> cds while police <unk> me
they're for the <unk> daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' <unk> this shit doesn't make sense b

it's all <unk> if my music is <unk>
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i <unk> i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too, <unk> that was a fist that hit you

(come on!) sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing that shit!)
for the laughter, sing for the tears (sing with me!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter <unk> and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get <unk>

see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just <unk> ourselves, we entertainers
of course the shit's <unk> our <unk> you <unk>

but music is <unk> of self, we just explain it
and then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
how we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
who post <unk> pictures on their walls all day long
<unk> they favorite rappers and know all they songs

or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

that's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our <unk> live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing it!)
for the laughter, sing for the tears (come on!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing it!)
for the laughter, sing for the tears (come on!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away<unk>

shawn carter was born december 4th
<unk> in at ten pounds, eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didn't give me any pain, when i gave birth to him
and that's how i knew, that he was a special child

<unk> baby, what's wrong? you look like, you've lost your best friend
tell me, is it something that i've done again?
you look like, you've lost your best friend

[verse one: jay-z]
they say they never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone
so on that note i'm leavin after this song

at least let me tell you why i'm this way, hold on
i was <unk> by <unk> carter and <unk> reeves
who made love under the <unk> tree
which makes me, a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real <unk> i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose was on <unk> i ain't perfect, i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
now i'm just <unk> the surface cause what's buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop <unk>
i went to school, got good <unk> could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when <unk>
hold on

[interlude: <unk> <unk>
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into <unk> and a funny story is
at four, he taught himself how to ride a bike
a <unk> at that, isn't that <unk>
but, i noticed a change in <unk> when me and my <unk> broke up

[verse two: jay-z]
now all the teachers couldn't reach me and my momma couldn't beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me <unk>
with <unk> in my <unk>
got on my pimp game, fuck the world, my <unk> came
then the <unk> introduced me to the game
spanish <unk> introduced me to <unk> i'm a hustler now
my gear is in, and i'm in the <unk>
and all the <unk> <unk> girls is lovin me now
my self-esteem went through the roof, man i got my <unk>
got a <unk> from this girl when her man got <unk>
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
<unk> - knowin nobody paid <unk> wack ass
i'm gettin ahead of myself, by the way, i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear, i would say about my rap career
'til <unk> came, niggaz i'm here - <unk>

[interlude: <unk> <unk>
shawn used to be in the <unk> beating on the table and rapping
and umm, into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a <unk>
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts
but, that was my way to keep him close to me, and out of trouble

[verse three: jay-z]
goodbye to the game all the <unk> the adrenaline rush
your blood <unk> you in a spot, knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop, you so easy to touch
no two days are <unk> except the 1st and <unk> pretty much
and <unk> is a word you <unk> hear from us
hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well <unk> up
you learn the worth of water
without work you thirst 'til you die - yup!
and niggaz get tied up for product
and little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got 'em
and this is the stress i lived with
'til i decided to try this rap shit for a livin
i pray i'm <unk> - for every bad decision i made
every sister i played - cause i'm still paranoid to this day
and it's nobody fault, i made the decisions i've made
this is the life i <unk> or rather the life that chose me

daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have gotten so bad between us i don't see us ever being together
ever again like we used to be when we was <unk>
but then of course everything always happens for a reason

i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

now hush little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
<unk> that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night

i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright

it's funny, i remember back one year, when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying

'cause daddy felt like a <unk> see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom

was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
on the <unk> in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on <unk>
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre and flew you and mama out to see me

but daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv
and mama didn't like it and you and <unk> were to young to understand it
papa was a rollin' <unk> momma <unk> a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house
just <unk> lookin' at your baby <unk> it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
<unk> i'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
i like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
<unk> mama's only gone for the moment

now hush little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
<unk> that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night

i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright

and if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a <unk>
i'mma give you the world
i'mma buy a diamond ring for you, i'mma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile

dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad, i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for <unk>

that's my little brother man, he's only six years old
we waited in the <unk> cold for you, four hours and you just said, <unk>
that's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' <unk>
he wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than i do

i ain't that mad though, i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in <unk> you said if i'd write you
you would write back, see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day, i <unk> away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm <unk>
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like <unk> the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real, and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you <unk>

but she don't know you like i know you slim, <unk> does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up

and all i wanted was a <unk> letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it

got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all

it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear stan, i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is <unk>
look, i'm really <unk> you would call your daughter that

you got some issues stan, i think you need some <unk>
to help your ass from <unk> off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be <unk>

the time it took me to get cool was a <unk> <unk>
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up <unk>
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
<unk> my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus she'd always give me <unk> on the first
if i <unk> staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than <unk>
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
so now its me and old school
<unk> playa playing chess looking through old school <unk> a airs
he knew i didn't really wanna post here

[verse 3: <unk> <unk>
before he knew he had a crew
that wasn't no punk
and they <unk> shirts
and <unk> <unk>
they would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
office building <unk> wasn't safe no more
and it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said
any escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy
they needed to break out
they head to any place with <unk>
any good <unk>
the world was <unk>
uh, and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said, <unk> no <unk> <unk>

[chorus:]
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's <unk> and <unk> and coast<unk>
sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of <unk> i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me <unk> so many babies screaming
cause they seeing <unk> before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all <unk> and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen the change <unk>
i keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
<unk> in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open now, can only say i'll try
until the day i die, i promise to be wise
with my heart open free, brings only misery
a way to <unk> so i stay sucker free
only a few <unk> rise <unk>
my ghetto <unk> rise <unk>
don't be afraid to try <unk>
too many of us died to the door to open wide
my brother be <unk> stay focused on the <unk>
though everybody dies
we <unk>

(eminem)
only learn to take, our anger and our hate
control our mental <unk> settle down, and just set it straight
maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
for we said it, regret it later, and let it <unk>
cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
theres only so much someone can swallow and <unk>
to the point that he just <unk> <unk> and thats all it takes
you'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
but we aint
its plain to go <unk> with every <unk> comes the image he <unk>
and a picture that he <unk>
but in the <unk> of all this anger and this <unk>
never once did you hear me say i'm a gangster and i aint hear no <unk>
but i know, that i will always continue to <unk>
as long as i lead and never follow no one else's shadow
there will never be another me
and that i can guarantee
thats why the fuck i remain sucker free to this day
the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame or success they <unk>
there will never be another me
and no matter what they do
there will never be another you
you can search but you'll never find
you can try to rewind time
but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die
we are forever alive
and we continue <unk>

<unk>
one day at a time

don't be caught in the <unk> and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money and light
searching for fortune and fame, and super <unk>
all the <unk> all the cars, whose crew is the <unk>
now the hip-hop police, the <unk> is watching
and kids think beef is the only option
<unk> born <unk> guilty as <unk>
my memories of him die, but <unk> lives on
you think the industry is fun
and no pity with guns
and when your money is up
thats when your enemies come
so if he died and came back
would he try to save <unk>
we <unk> a change, the drama remains

i spent my whole life, fighting myself
that i cant win so i'm <unk> some help
and every now and then i take rights from left
im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
and that there is a fight in itself
so i just pray and hope god
take a like to myself
no matter how much i try (stay <unk>
i'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride

heard <unk> beats, we past that
i'm trying to keep some <unk> coming in
and collect on my ass cap
the rappers in the game aint changed
and i finally realized that we not in the same game
the hating will never end, so i guess i'll deal wit it
them <unk> with cop killers, just some steel wit it
the streets is <unk> you gotta be a soldier
gotta stay <unk> and keep your eyes on the <unk>
as they do what they gotta do to <unk> and hold us
so we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
one way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
and we continue <unk>

<unk>

what's bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i run, i run, follow me, follow me

i've been driving around your side of this town
like nine <unk> hours and forty-five minutes now
finally i found your new <unk> park in your drive
feel like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life
and it's now arrived and my mouth is <unk> <unk>
my knife is out and i'm <unk> on the side of your house

see, it's sad it came to this point
such a <unk> i had to make this <unk> to come and see ya
but i ain't here for your <unk> i don't need your <unk>
or your <unk> or <unk> it's revenge that i seek

so i sneak <unk> and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full <unk> i <unk>
continue to <unk> still bent low then
keep <unk> the glass <unk> then start to <unk>

sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
man, door <unk> <unk> shouldn't be that easy to do this
you don't plan for <unk> <unk>
surprised to see me? cat got your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> almost <unk> up a lung
like you picked an <unk> up and <unk>
stick to the <unk> plan, <unk> to the back of a trunk
by one of your <unk> <unk> <unk> huh?
now who's a faggot, you <unk>
and here's your <unk> hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck

it's just me, you and the music now, slim
i hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
wait, here comes my favorite <unk>
"i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that <unk>
and hey, here's the sequel to my mathers lp
just to try to get people to buy

well, how's this for <unk> <unk> this should be fun
last album now, 'cause after this you'll be <unk> done
eminem killed by m and m
<unk> <unk> bitch, i even have your initials

i <unk> was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck
the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more <unk> time is quite near
hope we don't get <unk> no license i fear

that <unk> i <unk> guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the <unk> idea
as cops appear in my <unk> side mirror
(oh, god, police, <unk>
hope fox <unk> gets an <unk> shot of your burial plot
new plan stan
slim <unk> <unk> drove in this big, <unk> town <unk>
well, gotta go, almost at the <unk> ha ha big bro it's for you
slim, this is for him and frank <unk> oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate <unk> again

i also represent anyone on the <unk> end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
i'm your karma <unk> in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope, it's <unk> i'm the <unk> that you're <unk> in
when they say all of this is <unk> its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go, all over again

<unk> to the wall, i'm <unk> up all them <unk> <unk> <unk>
yeah 'cause i'm talking a lotta shit but i'm backing it all up
but in my head there's a voice in the back and it <unk>
after the track is <unk> "i am your lack of a <unk>

i'm the ringing in your ears, i'm the <unk> on the back of your <unk>
eating your vocal <unk> after your <unk>
i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't <unk>
grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too <unk> to swallow

i'm the <unk> you hate that you became
with every faggot you <unk>
coming back on ya every woman you insult
<unk> but the double <unk> you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
'cause marshall mathers the rappers <unk> half a <unk> and
<unk> and <unk> just <unk> of you not knowing what you have till it's gone
'cause after all the <unk> and the <unk> no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them

i'm the <unk> to say, i told you so
<unk> of all the things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you don't stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it <unk>

when it's time to walk away
i'm every <unk> trip the baggage you have
but as you gather up all your <unk>
if there's anything you have left to say
less it makes an <unk> then don't bother
so 'fore you rest your case
better make sure you're packing a <unk>

so, one last time, i'm back
'fore it fades into black and it's all over
<unk> the final chapter in a <unk>
trying to <unk> that <unk> trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started it all
<unk> <unk> of an artist <unk>
trapped in his own <unk>
tap into thoughts
<unk> and <unk> than anything <unk>
here goes a wild stab in the dark
uh, as we pick up where the last mathers left offyeah
check

sometimes i feel like <unk> and <unk> <unk> are the only ones with enough
to feel what i'm about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
it is when all the press <unk> happening and the cameras get to <unk>
and they try to make you out as a lie
<unk> cuz you were just trying to please em' by using <unk> and reason
it's a <unk> why even try
when your ideas so <unk> get <unk> and people just get <unk>
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that you're <unk> for someone without the <unk>
to try and make em a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working what i'm <unk> at first
and niggas wanna say that you ain't around
i mean there's always some blame to put on <unk> 'stead of <unk> you couldn't help
and maybe next time you ain't in town

chorus:
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try, <unk>

and the <unk> make you <unk> to pressure and you spittin' the pressure
than most of the rappers running the game
concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit to cash
there's time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i ran
sometimes i wish that i woulda just <unk> on the sneakers and watched the game from the <unk>
cuz i'm really telling me what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother don't <unk> for the other time
i wasted late out at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i working hard on the winner
so this album is a <unk> of love
you say as long as i'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
then she can rest without a toss or a turn
cuz she know that my reputation <unk> me and people watch me on tv
that's exactly why i often get burned
but i'm gonna try <unk>

try harder cuz
try, <unk>yeah, what up? this shiny suit man
now, i know you've heard my name before
you know, whether it was out the mouths of other rappers
or you know, the <unk> or you know
whoever else wanna say my name, <unk> suit <unk>

but they not wanna say my government name
my government name is sean <unk> sean john <unk>
some of you may even know me as <unk> puff daddy or p. diddy
but i just wanna get the record straight

that when they talking about the shiny suit
they talking about me
and i own this five hundred million dollar shiny suit

and, oh yeah, next time say my name

open your mind you see the circus in the <unk>

and just like a <unk> with <unk> waves
do the same with the pot,

is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel
if there is then let me hear
just so i know that i'm not the only one

so there it is, damn
it feels like i just woke up or something
i guess i just forgot who the fuck i was, man
hey yo, and to anybody that i thought about going at
it was never nothin' <unk> it was jus' some shit i was going through
and to everybody <unk> i'm back, hehthis is survival of the <unk>
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

wasn't ready to be no millionaire, i was <unk>
i was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
in the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
it was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an <unk>

cut the fucking act like you're happy i'm fucking back again
with another <unk> why stop when it doesn't have to <unk>
it ain't over till i say it's over, enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up

i'm afraid of <unk> happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown into an <unk> <unk> i <unk> it
raise your hands up like it's twelve <unk> nah, homie
hold them bitches <unk> up, wave 'em till you <unk> a <unk> cuff

came up <unk> came to <unk> <unk> nah, <unk>
i ain't <unk> enough, last chance to make this whole <unk> <unk>

this is survival of the <unk>
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the <unk> maybe i can just <unk> enough
to fill up this last can, man will i survive in this <unk> or what?
they said i was washed up, and got a blood bath
i'm not a rapper, i'm an <unk> i can <unk>
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so <unk> open if you'd like to discuss

top 5 in this mothafucka and if i don't make the cut
what, like i give a fuck, i will light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
into the side of a pump, zero to 60 hop in and gun it
like g-unit without the <unk> i'm <unk> 'em up

and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a <unk>
and i look like i might just give up, eh you <unk> <unk>

with a fucking knife in the <unk> while i'm <unk> my butt

'cause i just <unk> on the mic, and i like getting cut

to show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got her
god i'm a daddy, i'm so glad that her mom didn't want her

now you probably get this picture from my public <unk>
that i'm a <unk> drug addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be <unk> honest
'cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul

and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this <unk> on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world, and i think my neck is breakin'
should i just give up or try to live up to these <unk>

now look, i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's <unk> to make my life livin' hell
but i handle it well, given the <unk> i'm dealt
so many <unk> man it's too bad, coulda had someone else

but the years that i've wasted is nothin' to the tears that i've <unk>
so here's what i'm <unk> 3 <unk> 6 years of <unk>
i've went to jail for this woman, i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken <unk> to peoples <unk> bent over backwards for this woman

man i shoulda seen it <unk> <unk> i stick my penis up in?
<unk> ripped the <unk> up if i'd seen what she was fuckin'
but fuck it it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby, baby the only lady that i adore, hailie

so <unk> try <unk> nice to know ya
my baby's <unk> back to the arms of her <unk> owner
and suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just <unk>
it's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been <unk>

now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's <unk> me
'cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
nothin' can take her from me

woo!
i told you i can't <unk>
oh well, i <unk>
<unk> 'member when i said "if you ever need anything, daddy will be right <unk>
well guess what?
daddy's here. and i ain't goin' nowhere baby.

i just can't get past these little <unk>
that wanna be <unk> bad asses so bad
and they so mad, they can't stand it
cause we can and they can't spit <unk>
and they can't handle it like a man
and that's when it just happens
and i snap then it's a wrap, then it's a <unk>
an it isn't rap is it?
hip-hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
maybe i'm old <unk> but my passion
is to smash anyone rappin without havin a <unk>
believe me i'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when i'm pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
cause i'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then i'm pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a bit, boy, you get bit, b
these words stick to you like crazy glue
when you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do, 50
i'm the <unk> thing and your gonna miss me when i'm gone

dear slim, i wrote but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in <unk> you must <unk> got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

sometimes i <unk> addresses too sloppy when i <unk> 'em
but <unk> fuck it, what's been up? man, how's your <unk>
my girlfriend's pregnant too, i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'mma call her? i'mma name her bonnie

i read about your uncle <unk> too, i'm <unk>
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam

i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with <unk> <unk> that shit was <unk>
anyways, i hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
truly yours, your biggest fan, this is stan

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad, i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for <unk>

that's my little brother man, he's only six years old
we waited in the <unk> cold for you, four hours and you just said, <unk>
that's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' <unk>
he wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than i do

i ain't that mad though, i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in <unk> you said if i'd write you
you would write back, see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day, i <unk> away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm <unk>
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like <unk> the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real, and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you <unk>

but she don't know you like i know you slim, <unk> does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man, i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
<unk> yours, stan
<unk> we should be together, too

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear mr. <unk>
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass!
it's been six months and still no word, i don't deserve it?
i know you got my last two <unk> i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

so this is my cassette i'm sending you, i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now, i'm doing 90 on the freeway
hey slim, i drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
you know the song by phil <unk> "in the air <unk>

about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from <unk>
but didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
that's kinda how this is, you coulda <unk> me from drowning
now it's too late, i'm on a thousand <unk> now, i'm <unk>

and all i wanted was a <unk> letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it
you ruined it now, i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

and when you dream, i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience <unk> at you and you can't breathe without me
see <unk> shut up bitch! i'm tryin' to <unk>
hey slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

but i didn't slit her throat, i just tied her up, see i ain't like you
'cause if she <unk> she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well, gotta go, i'm almost at the bridge now - oh, shit! i <unk>
how am i supposed to send this shit out?

my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

dear stan, i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is <unk>
look, i'm really <unk> you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother, i wrote it on the starter cap

i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show, i musta missed you
don't think i did that shit <unk> just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists <unk>
i say that shit just <unk> <unk> c'mon, how fucked up is you?

you got some issues stan, i think you need some <unk>
to help your ass from <unk> off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be <unk>
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each <unk>

i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this <unk> i just hope it <unk> you in time
before you hurt yourself, i think that you'll be doin' just fine

if you relax a little, i'm glad i inspire you, but stan

i've been down that road and now i'm back, sittin' on square one
tryna pick myself up where i started from

obie trice
i never woulda thought that i'd see you outta control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like <unk> to soul
nothing could <unk> us, especially no hoes

you was more or so the <unk> type, i chose
to more <unk> <unk> you nights i suppose
that's how it go, with time <unk> emotion grows
in the beginning, friends we decided to roll

so who's responsible when you get <unk> explode
and <unk> <unk> then you invite that <unk> cold

we <unk> this way before we became <unk>

so whats <unk> is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

eminem
i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as <unk> you to my daughters
till you went as far as goin' and <unk> through my drawers

now i just feel stupid for the <unk> that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls

if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked i <unk> to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a <unk> it struck me as <unk> but it turned me on

you started getting <unk> on me, pretty soon we'd argue
and the <unk> you got, the more beautiful you got to me
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought <unk>
<unk> could shoot another one of them goddamn <unk> at me

it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
but see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
till you pull up and see some other <unk> car parked and reach

up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life <unk>
and just as you <unk> and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words <unk> almost <unk> that <unk> ring

spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right, 'cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

<unk> <unk>
yeah right, bitch. spend some time on my <unk>

in most <unk> <unk> attitude is <unk>
my only <unk> is to get head and fuck a bitch

even held your hand in public

we <unk> because of this
shorty on some whole <unk> other shit
tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick
i'll <unk> i was caught in the <unk> down to commit
feed you the best of me, i shoulda fed you piss

we started off closer than close
but who coulda predicted to know, your <unk> ways woulda stopped our <unk>
and the final <unk> back in that same boat
i ask myself, do i love these <unk> no!

50 cent
em introduced us, "50 this is <unk> <unk> this is <unk>
then slid off and left her to kick it with me
i <unk> her, i said you have very nice lips

[chorus 2x]<div <unk> sometimes you just feel tired,
feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.
but you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a <unk> no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

yo left, yo left, yo left right left

till i <unk> spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
till the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killing them
'cause when i am not then i'ma stop <unk> 'em
and i am not hip-hop and just not <unk>
<unk> thoughts when i'm stop sending them women are caught in <unk> spin and <unk> venom
adrenaline shots of <unk> could not get the <unk> to stop.
<unk> is just not real <unk>
the criminal cop killing hip-hop <unk> a <unk> <unk> to cop millions of pac <unk>
you're coming with me, feel it or not gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
you hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop <unk> up.
for <unk> my <unk> this is the plot listen up you <unk> forgot <unk> does not give a <unk>

till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

music is like magic a certain feeling you get when you're real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit.
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.
so while in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its <unk>
'cause i'm at the end of my <unk> with half this shit that gets in.
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
it goes <unk> jay-z, tupac and <unk> andre from <unk> <unk> <unk> nas and then me.
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of <unk> so when not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's <unk> me.
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
you hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
the <unk> wet dream like bobby and <unk> nate hit me.

till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

soon as a verse starts i eat it at heart
what is he <unk> how not to go against me? <unk>
and it's <unk> how people hang on every <unk>
probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but never be served my spot is forever <unk>
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me <unk>
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be <unk>
why clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are <unk> i act like an addict
i rap like addicted to smack like kim <unk>
but i want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some <unk>
so this is like a full blown attack <unk> at them
the track is on some <unk> raps who want some <unk>
'cause i really think that the fact that slim matters
a <unk> of platinum status is whack if i'm not the <unk>

till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, shut my mouth.
till the smoke clears out - am i high? <unk>
i'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

until the roof <unk> the <unk>
the roof comes off (the roof comes off)
until my legs <unk> my <unk>
give out from underneath me (give out form underneath me)

guess that's what they say you need family for
'cause i can't depend on you anymore

always saw you for what you could've been
ever since you met me
like when <unk> made that one car that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you could've been
and even when it's business with you it's personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me

and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

you sit and you pray hoping that the stars <unk>
my luck is a sure thing 'cause i'm living right

but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way

all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer

the <unk> walked in (what's going on in <unk>
and started <unk> him stomp me

"this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the <unk> and drank my chocolate milk
every time you <unk> my tray and it dropped and <unk>

(eminem)
oh, <unk>these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with <unk> hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no <unk>
it's so scary in a house that <unk> no swearing

to see him walking around with his headphones <unk>
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
he's a problem child and what <unk> him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
but if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are <unk> he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

he <unk> his pants, <unk> and a <unk> cap
his <unk> hit him so he <unk> him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(chorus from <unk> dream on)
(come on!) sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing it!)
for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is <unk> <unk> with gangstas
in the land of the killers, a <unk> mind is a <unk>
holy or <unk> only have one homie
only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

yet everybody just feels like they can relate
i guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can <unk> or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single <unk> we make

like they <unk> us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this <unk> happen
from standin' on corners and <unk> just rappin'
to havin' a <unk> no more kissin' ass

but then these critics <unk> you, <unk> try to burn you
fans turn on you, <unk> all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad

so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any <unk> won't hesitate to produce <unk>
that's why these <unk> wanna <unk> me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

but all they kids be listenin' to me <unk>
so i'm <unk> cds while police <unk> me
they're for the <unk> daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' <unk> this shit doesn't make sense b

it's all <unk> if my music is <unk>
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i <unk> i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too, <unk> that was a fist that hit you

(come on!) sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing that shit!)
for the laughter, sing for the tears (sing with me!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter <unk> and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get <unk>

see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just <unk> ourselves, we entertainers
of course the shit's <unk> our <unk> you <unk>

but music is <unk> of self, we just explain it
and then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
how we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
who post <unk> pictures on their walls all day long
<unk> they favorite rappers and know all they songs

or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

that's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our <unk> live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing it!)
for the laughter, sing for the tears (come on!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

sing with me, (sing!) for the year (sing it!)
for the laughter, sing for the tears (come on!)
sing it with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you awayjay-z:

so he just <unk> and he <unk>
<unk> and spins till he <unk> himself into rage
and its <unk> him slowly
cuz he does not even know me
even though he sees me everywhere he goes
so he just <unk> himself
he has no fortune and wealth

this song is dedicated to all the happy <unk>
all the happy people, who have real nice lives, and have no idea whats it like, to be broke as <unk>

i feel like i'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
poppin' <unk> i'm a nervous wreck
i deserve respect, but i work a sweat for this worthless check
'bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

minimum <unk> got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and <unk> especially when i'm <unk>
and my <unk> down to her last <unk> it's got my ass <unk>
i pray that god <unk> maybe i'll ask nicer

watchin' ballers while they flossin' in their <unk>
these <unk> stars, becoming autograph <unk>
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the <unk> and average <unk>

but player haters turnin' bitch like they have <unk>
'cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money will <unk> you and leave your ass <unk>
snakes <unk> in the grass <unk>

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

my life is full of empty <unk> and broken dreams
i'm hoping things look up, but there ain't no job <unk>
i feel <unk> hungry and <unk>
livin' in this house with no <unk> <unk>

and i'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
and i'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
but fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
'cause when we die, we know we all going the same way

'cause it's cool to be the player, but it <unk> to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury <unk> comfortable and <unk> in a six
but they threw me in the mix with all these <unk> <unk>

who walk around <unk> and smoke a pound of <unk> a day
and yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball, but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

there's people that love me and people that hate me
but it's the evil that made me this <unk> <unk> and shady
i want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
if it means i end up burning in hell, <unk> in flames

if it means i'm <unk> your <unk> and <unk> your name
this lifetime <unk> for <unk> torture and pain
'cause right now, i feel like just hit the rock bottom
i got problems, now everybody on my blocks got 'em

i'm screaming like them two cops, when 2pac shot 'em
holding two <unk> i hope your doors got new <unk> on 'em
my <unk> feet ain't got no shoes or <unk> on 'em
and them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em

and while you <unk> 'em, i could be takin' 'em to <unk> to <unk> 'em
i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em
'cause i never went gold off one song
i'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal

i'mma use my head as a weapon

<unk> you must, rick <unk> my little <unk>

a <unk> in <unk> <unk> brain and, thoughts of entertaining
but <unk> and impossible to explain and, i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso <unk>

puke <unk> but sound like <unk> when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog
can't even find the <unk> i was writing this rhyme on, <unk>

it's on a <unk> couldn't see what i wrote, i write small
(it <unk> ever since i drove a <unk> <unk> with white walls
had a fire in my heart, and a <unk> desire to <unk> to die hard
so as long as i'm on the clock <unk> this time card
hip hop ain't dying on my watch

but sometimes, when sleeping
she comes to me in my dreams

got, care, have two shits to give

let me take you by the hand to promise land
and <unk> everyone
'cause no rhyme or no reason for nothing, nah

what happens when you become the main source of a pain?

a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter
but <unk>

[verse 1:]
i met this new girl late june or early <unk>
i called her a bunch of times but she barely <unk>
now it's <unk> i'm <unk> and she's like where's my <unk>
i swear, that i never called you cause i really get shy
see that was a <unk> i believe the matter
is what happens after the <unk> where the leaves just <unk>
where the <unk> laces get tighter and <unk> hoods flip up
drugs dealers standin and they <unk> hoods slip up
where girls become <unk> from summer's caught <unk>
the winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
and some places is <unk> and some it start <unk>
and if you planning family <unk> you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
where <unk> college <unk> <unk> water on their <unk>

<unk> over chorus]
yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls <unk> wanna get <unk> you might think they the one
but just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[verse 2:]
forget to <unk> this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet
since i'm <unk> i ask her how to get the suite
she doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
she <unk> her bag in the back, and starts <unk> the heat
she's bold but i roll with it, i'm impressed cause she's sweet
then she says "i heard your song and i'm <unk> with the beat,
i mean, the lyrics are good, but i'm <unk> with the beat
i love it when <unk> <unk> and the chorus is good,
there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you <unk>
off this i'm kinda takin it back for a second,
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do, and it's kind of <unk> the surface hard to scratch
until we end up <unk> and now my heart attached
i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern
and <unk> all that she wanted was that <unk> lovin and ho!

<unk> over chorus]
yeah, uh, i told ya'll i had a story for you right
uh, ya man, it's what it is

[verse 3:]
and now, i'm proud to have her like <unk> to the <unk>
she love to play hurt like carter did on the <unk>
but, my boy say i'm actin different, because i lay <unk>
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and <unk>
she tellin everyone imma hold here down
tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her,
instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
but then spring shows up, and it's <unk> in this bitch
the weather starts to <unk> the <unk> she missed
when we were together it <unk> like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play <unk> and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for <unk> she saving for <unk>
and it's a <unk> she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
i <unk> i lost another one to the <unk>

<unk> + <unk>
i miss you, most of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fades <unk>
<unk> a second to gather my <unk>

the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light <unk> and a couple drinks might get her,
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and we'd <unk> a <unk> a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
we had <unk> hearts always gettin <unk> and stolen
but this summer is different it's a two man operation
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause <unk> them crack is a one man sport
instead of <unk> i walk in sweat pants and <unk> <unk>
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
the face, the <unk> the <unk> the toes
i'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
we'll never talk again, scary and true

but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob (hi <unk> <unk> 30 and still lives with his mom
he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and <unk> pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for <unk> off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the <unk> block

and even if they <unk> and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
till one night mrs. stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block, uh
you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to <unk> they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (come on)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad <unk> your hand)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
and there's really nothing else to say (sing <unk>
drugs are just bad, m'kay

my penis is the size of a <unk> have you seen it
fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
speaking of <unk> you know what else is bad for squirrels
<unk> it's the worst drug in the world

if someone ever <unk> it to you, don't do it
kids, two <unk> probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is <unk> you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

meet <unk> 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a <unk> party, he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's <unk> by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

<unk> he starts to <unk> and his <unk>
goes into <unk> and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up, looks like the <unk> arches
he's on <unk> <unk> layin' <unk> <unk>

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey <unk> <unk> is a <unk> look at <unk>
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile <unk> in a <unk> the action is over
and his back and his shoulders <unk> up like he's practicing <unk>
and that's the story of <unk> the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (that's right)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

so kids say no to drugs <unk> <unk>
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
and there's really nothing else to say (uh huh)
drugs are just bad, m'kay

and last but not <unk> one of the most <unk>
problems among young people today, is <unk>
it grows from cow <unk> they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it <unk> <unk>

and then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything <unk> down when you eat some of 'em
and sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
like fat women in <unk> with orange hair

"mr. shady, what's a <unk> it's <unk> <unk>
women stick them up their <unk> go out and wear 'em
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms, i meant <unk>

your tongue <unk> all <unk> up like a cow's tongue (how <unk>
'cause it comes from a cow's <unk>
see drugs are bad, it's a common fact
but your mom and dad, know that's all that i'm good at

but don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and od
they're gonna come for me, and i'ma have to grow a <unk>
and get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
so don't drugs and do exactly as i don't, because i'm bad for you

mr. mackey impersonation (eminem):
see children, drugs are bad (uh huh)
and if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)
and if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can <unk>
she'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will)

so kids say no to drugs (say no)
so you don't act like everyone else does (like i do)
and there's really nothing else to say (that's right)
drugs are just bad, m'kay

eminem impersonating mr. mackey &amp; eric cartman :

fuck ya'll rest of ya'll <unk>
ya heard me?step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall <unk>

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his <unk>
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter

i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an <unk>
i need to be the <unk> my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever just pop off, i'm supposed to be beside 'em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy, this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit

and even though the battle was won, i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it, <unk> i'm <unk>
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for, it's not why i got in it

that was never my <unk> for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped <unk>
it wasn't my <unk> my intentions was good
i went through my whole career without ever <unk> it

now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
so i did, i just fell back, watched and <unk> my teeth

while he's all over tv down talkin' a man
who literally saved my life, like "fuck it, i <unk>
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's <unk> 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets <unk> it ain't just words no more is it?

it's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

until ja started <unk> in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some <unk> at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an <unk> for me and thinks that i'll be his <unk>
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that <unk> the same one that made me famous

now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
when i'm so busy being pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just <unk> 50's beef with murder <unk>

and he's <unk> mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to <unk> us, strictly to show they support us

we'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have <unk> avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it, i can't think of a <unk> way to word it
than to just say that i love ya'll too much to see the <unk>
i'll walk away from it all before i let it go any further

but don't get it twisted, it's not a <unk> that i'm coppin'
i'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
off at your jaws with the <unk> 'cause <unk> i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiersjamie foxx and luther vandross:

and walk around the rest of my life spit on

and that's pretty much the <unk> of it
parents are <unk> but the kids love it
nine <unk> heaters <unk> in <unk> with meat <unk>
i don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither

it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

yesterday was the <unk> <unk> today is like the morning after
your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
<unk> and you're still a work in progress
today is a whole new <unk> it's like an enormous ass
the <unk> has passed ya, your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the <unk> bush that you
used to smell the <unk> stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the <unk> then you floor the gas <unk> and hit the corner fast, the more <unk> never looking back, may hit the curb, but everyday is a new learning <unk> as you, steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna <unk> but you have to, to <unk> a <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk> cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass, and threw dirt on your <unk> but you <unk> from the <unk> and that hurt that you have, you just <unk> to <unk> and while you're burning the past, standing at <unk> and <unk>

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames

settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

so <unk> what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive which means you must survive
although today you may <unk> because you're weak and
everything seems so bleek and <unk>
the light that you're <unk> it begins to seep in
that's the only thing keeping you from <unk> off the <unk> deep end
and i'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the <unk>
and by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
to forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
this feeling of <unk> is building and the flames are burning
quick as fire would through this building, you're <unk> in
but you're <unk> and flame <unk> you <unk> it
and as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
cause you're so over them you could put the <unk> of your foot through the ceiling

as time <unk> things change everyday
but <unk> wounds heal
but scars still <unk> the same
but tomorrow <unk> gone down in flames
throw the match at the past up place

so feel the fire beneath your feet
as you barely even <unk> from the heat
<unk> deep and breathe a <unk> of <unk>
and as you say goodbye to the <unk>
it's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
but you've <unk> this living hell
still a little piece of you <unk> you scream

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the <unk>

feel the burn, watch the smoke as i turn
<unk> a <unk> from the flames
flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight
now it feels with these wings that i will fly

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the lightroyce: what? uh

or taking pictures with some <unk> in front of the drop
the streets is watching

when the, streets is watching
blocks keep <unk>
waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
can't ignore it

man, it's hard not to kill niggas
it's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
the streets is watching you, when you froze your arms
niggas wanna test you and your gun goes warm
can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up
sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
once you're <unk> lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your <unk> so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap niggas wanna steal ya

<unk> up, the streets is <unk> it's on

<unk>
my street <unk> flip bricks forever, know me and money
we like armed <unk> nigga we stick together
shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see if <unk> time came around
now you can look up and down the streets and i can't be found
put in <unk> hour <unk> but, niggas mouths got slow <unk>
had to hide between my <unk> couldn't play those streets
stay outta space like <unk> you <unk> me? <unk>
had to call upon my wolves to <unk> niggas the message
i said <unk> <unk> play fair and we can stay here
i'm trying to <unk> you boyz ii men like <unk>
hey there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer
then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff
had <unk> the other half, in the casket lay <unk>
i felt like life was <unk> me, for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
was this a lesson god <unk> me? was he saying that?
i'm playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke, pimp or die, was my <unk> bad
was niggas was thinkin <unk> was turnin cocaine <unk>
ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to <unk> a stack
and not <unk> like two <unk> that's on the same track
'fore i get my life together like the <unk> i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot
got my <unk> take it <unk> the border then stop
set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan
for three straight <unk> niggas <unk> the block
but you know the game is <unk> that fucked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
and this <unk> way of living just, had to stop
half of my niggas got time, we done real things
by <unk> became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
public <unk> to the families of those caught up in my shit
but that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the shit
the life and times of a nigga mind, excited with crime
and the lavish <unk> that just excited my mind
i <unk> <unk> why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me, and if you don't like it then <unk>
the <unk> of a nigga who <unk> the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get mecover my tracks like butter so where da bread be
