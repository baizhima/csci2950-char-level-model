voted most likely
to end up on the back of a milk box drink
looks like i'm letting 'em down
'cause $7.75
isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
when you can't afford half the shit they advertise
oh i'm worth more than an ex
more than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
ohh i won't settle no oh
oh i can't settle

i wanna break the mold
wanna break the stereotype
fist in the air
i'm not going down with out a fight

(chorus)
it's my life
and i'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
pass me by
i'm leaving you my legacy
i gotta make my mark
i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me
i'm leaving my fingerprints
i'm leaving my fingerprints on you

representing you and me
don't you wanna go down in history
rather than end up
begging on the streets
trading undertable favors
for a place to sleep
'cause i'm worth more than this
so stop writing prescriptions for more ritalin
i can focus my attention

i wanna break the mold
wanna break the stereotype
fist in the air
i'm not going down with out a fight

(chorus)
it's my life
and i'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
pass me by
i'm leaving you my legacy
i gotta make my mark
i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me
i'm leaving my fingerprints

don't give up
don't give in
build your house on the rock
oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

(chorus)
it's my life
and i'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
pass me by
i'm leaving you my legacy
i gotta make my mark
i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me

it's my life
and i'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
pass me by
i'm leaving you my legacy
i gotta make my mark
i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me
'cause i'm leaving my fingerprints
i'm leaving my fingerprints
i'm leaving my fingerprints in the end<div class="lyricbox">through this skin you see my heart
through this laughter you feel my pain
even through this mask you see my face
for you are the only one who really knows just who i am

and you search me
and you know all the secrets of my heart
revealing the mysteries of who you are
you search me

growing up never comes easily
in your hands, the potter molding me
then why do i wear this mask and play this game of hide and seek
when you are the only one who really knows just who i am

and you search me
and you know all the secrets of my heart
revealing the mysteries of who you are
you search me

my father
my father
you are my father
oh, and i am your child
and you hear my cry
even at the midnight

and you search me
and you know all the secrets of my heart
revealing the mysteries of who you are
you search me</div>i hope you hang yourself with your h&amp;m scarf

i just wanna use your love
tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
i don't wanna lose your love tonight

i just wanna use your love
tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
i don't wanna lose your love tonight

i just wanna use your love, love

trying to stop my head from spinning
too much to drink, not making sense
it's been a while since i've been with someone new
but i can't stop the way i'm feeling

as you leave, please could you just close the door?
now that our love affair is over
you're exactly what i was looking for
go find a shoulder to cry upon

i just wanna use your love
tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
i don't wanna lose your love tonight...

i just wanna use your love
(oh, i just wanna use your love, baby)

all i own is my thoughts for my fears
i close the door to keep out the bad
i plug my ears to keep out these fears

and i cry
so hold me close
for i'm so tired of holding myself
so very tired and tired
tired and tired
just hold me

i listen to these voices
or is it this house that's giving me chills
as i lie upon this little girls bed?
who's at the door? who's walking near?
or has my imagination spilled?
this little girl all grown up still fears

oh, and i cry
so hold me close
for i'm so tired of holding myself
so very tired and tired
tired and tired
just hold me

where can i go, where can i hide
from these evil sufferings?
oh, these images painted on my walls
they say there's a place that i can
hide in the shadow of your wings
oh lord, bring me to this place of refuge

no more tears
so hold me close
for i'm so tired of holding myself
so very tired and tired
tired and tired
just hold melay me down at your altar, baby
i'm a slave to this love
your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues

i have prayed for a power like you
to see deep down in my soul
oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

magical one, a mystery
all of your charms have worked on me
i will surrender myself
holy hell and heaven high
you have opened up my eyes
and i am finally healed

it's like the wind changed your mind
we were best friends
yeah, we were building a life

with every kiss and every letter
every promise of forever
oh, but you hit "send"
and disappeared in front of my eyes

and now you're just a ghost
when i look back, never would have known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

there's just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my vision's 20/20
i see through you now

something has died
now that i have made up my mind
i'll be alright
it doesn't haunt me at night

'cause every gift and every letter
every promise of forever
now, it's out of sight
like you were never alive

and now you're just a ghost
when i look back, never would have known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

there's just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my vision's 20/20
i see through you now
now, now, now, now
now, now, now, now now

so rest in peace
i'll see you on the other side

and now you're just a ghost
when i look back, never would have known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

there's just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my vision's 20/20
i see through you now
now, now, now, now
now, now, now, now now

i see through you now
now, now, now, now
now, now, now, now now
i see through you now<div class="lyricbox">i can feel a phoenix inside of me
as i march alone to a different beat
slowly swallowing down my fear
i am ready for the road less traveled
suiting up for my crowning battle
this test is my own cross to bear
but i will get there

never easy to be chosen
never easy to be called
standing on the front line
when the bombs start to fall
i can see the heavens
but i still hear the flames
calling out my name

i can see the writing on the wall
i ignore this war
at the end of it all
who am i living for?

i can feel this light inside of me
growing fast into a bolt of lightning
i know one spark will shock the world
so i pray for favor like esther
i need your strength to handle the pressure
i know there will be sacrifice
but the price

never easy to be chosen
never easy to be called
standing on the front line
when the bombs start to fall
and i can see the heavens
but i still hear the flames
calling out my name

i can see the writing on the wall
i ignore this war
at the end of it all
who am i living for?
i can see the writing on the wall
i ignore this war
at the end of it all
who am i living for?

at the end, at the end
who am i living for?

heavy is the head that wears the crown
let the greatness get you down

i can see the writing on the wall
i ignore this war
at the end of it all
who am i living for?
i can see the writing on the wall
i ignore this war
at the end of it all
who am i living for?

at the end, at the end
who am i living for?
who am i living for?</div><div class="lyricbox">i wanna see your peacock-cock-cock

pink flamingos in the pool

barbies on the barbecue
this a hickey or a bruise?

pictures of last night
ended up online
i'm screwed
oh well

it's a blacked out blur
but i'm pretty sure
it ruled
damn

last friday night
yeah, we danced on tabletops
and we took too many shots
think we kissed but i forgot

last friday night
yeah, we maxed our credit cards
ended kicked out of the bar
so we hit the boulevard

last friday night
we went streaking in the park
skinny-dipping in the dark
then had a trois

last friday night
yeah, i think we broke the law
always say we're gonna sto-op
whoa!

but this friday night
do it all again

trying to connect the dots
don't know what to tell my boss
think the city towed my car
chandelier is on the floor

ripped my favorite party dress
warrants out for my arrest
think i need a ginger ale
that was such an epic fail

do it all again</div>do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

do you ever feel already buried deep?
six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'cause there's a spark in you

you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the fourth of july

'cause baby, you're a firework
come on, show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go "ah, ah, ah!"
as you shoot across the sky-y-y

baby, you're a firework
come on, let your colors burst
make 'em go "ah, ah, ah!"
you're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

you don't have to feel like a waste of space
you're original, cannot be replaced
if you only knew what the future holds
after a hurricane, comes a rainbow

maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
and when it's time you know

you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the fourth of july

'cause baby, you're a firework
come on, show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go "ah, ah, ah!"
as you shoot across the sky-y-y

even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
it's always been inside of you, you, you
and now it's time to let it through

'cause baby, you're a firework

a photograph of mine
to show this public eye what i have to offer
i may not have a phd
or speak in eloquent philosophy
i'm nothing more than simply me you see

what i am trying to say
i'm just a babe in so many ways

i'm still growing, still stretching
still breaking in these new shoes
looking for a way to make a mark of my own
i'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
it's a part of life so there's no need to fear
these growing pains that i'm going through

i don't regret, i'm not ashamed
that i haven't yet begun to speaketh ways
as the wisest of men
oh, perhaps some day
but for now i'm grateful
to be a part of the family tree
while the man upstairs does his work on me
it's a job that may take eternity to complete

just when i've learned all i can
those growing pains up and kick on in again

what i am trying to say
i'm just a babe in so many ways

time after time
one more time and again
will it ever end?
it's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
but young or old i am told the same
oh, these growing pains never go away
so i'll just keep on trying

oh, baby worry about a thing</div>
