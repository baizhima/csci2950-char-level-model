Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride
Oh oh
Just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to show me the light
Not just for the meanwhile
For a long long time, better believe it

Oh oh
Whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missin' my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
Till you're back again oh yeah yeah

You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missin' my lover

Got a whole lotta texts on my phone and I don't reply
The next eight bars tell you why

You're all that matters to me yeah yeah
Worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me yeah yeah

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team
To make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you

Oh oh
Grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You're all that matters to me yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me yeah yeah

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team
To make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You're all that matters to me

Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow

So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking

Now I'm all singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
That tells 'em my life is too much and moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

I always up too late I worry bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady

I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money I'm still young and just unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose

I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose

 I love the way you make me feel
 I love it, I love it
 Tú eres todo para mí
 Te amo, I love it

[Mac Miller:]
 Say, I'm thinkin' 'bout her, every second, every hour
 Do my singin' in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like "do she love me? do she love me not?"
 I ain't a player I just...

[Ariana Grande:]
 You give me that kind of something, want it all the time, need it everyday
 On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
 Never get enough, I can't stay away
 If you want what I got, I got it everyday
 You can get whatever you need from me
 Stay by your side, I'll never leave you and I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

[Chorus:]
 So don't you worry, te necesito
 I got a bad boy, I must admit it
 You got my heart, don't know how you did it
 And I don't care who sees it, babe
 I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
 I love the way you make me feel
 I love it, I love it
 No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
 The way I love you

 Oh, estoy loca, no no no no puedo ya dejarte de pensar

 Llevame al cielo, enamorame
 Baby, yo quiero (estar contigo)
 No te vayas, escucha lo que digo

When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
To hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Eerything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you

And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way

Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else

Oh, that you know
So that's it baby

Love it then come and get it
I know that you're fuckin' with it
You see me, you like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?

Love it then play it back
Plus, where the 40 at?
I'm fucking your cheap thrill
On top of my fifty mill

He eating the cake, killa
On it, but don't kill her
My jewelers are diamond rollers
My rock... chinchilla!

Got fifty motherfuckers in my watch with my pants down

Monas are rolling loudies
And my bitches sold Bugatti

Bodies of Dulcattis'll do what the fuck you want

How could you be so hood but you so fuckin' pop?
How could you be so fun and sound like you sellin' rocks?

What's in the chain? Dollars.
What's in my chain? Dollars.
All of the big dollars got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars, I was in the back line
I'm standing in the bank line
You throwing up the gang sign

Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh the ideas funny, oh the ideas funny
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for homerun every time

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road and the East end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
This pain is my heart (oh oh oh)

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me, giving you flowers
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
oh-oh-oh-ohh
That should be me
Never should've let you go hey ey
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go

[Bun B - Verse 1]
Now when it come to making money I'm a printing press
When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test
I run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history I'm like (?) son
A million ways to die you already chose one
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
We on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
And while ya there let em know we did it just for them
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
Is that the King of the trill go tell em yes it's him
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us
Now thats a plus on the report card not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters
You got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us

[Drake - Chorus]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

[Bun B - Verse 2]
They know I'm on a Port Arthur state of mind southern superstar status
I elevate the crime
My time is money so I put some money on my time
Lightening on the Breitling so exciting when you see that shine
We on that leather (?) before its never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
And in '0-10 we finna go in
So let the opposition know there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
Tell em stand down before it's man down

[Drake - Chorus]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

[Drake - Verse 3]
I gotta hundred girls on each phone
Drissy Drake man, young sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Home sick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time everyday we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard n-gga I'm quoting more n-gga
Results are in I guess you should have voted more n-gga
Swimming in the money y'all just float ashore n-gga
Never drowning what the f-ck you think this boat is for n-gga
Yeah I'm quick to take an RnB diva out
I'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done I'll put some slippers on and see them out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just trying to keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler everyday I'm riding clean
Ohhh

[Drake - Chorus]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down.
I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours boy
The way your body moves across the floor
You got me feelin' n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

Baby the minute I feel your energy
The vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

I love to love you baby

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Repeat to end]
<div class="lyricbox">Now you finally tell me how you feel;
Guess your words just came a little too late...
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill;
Don’t be mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced - know your place!

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it’d be different - if you spoke, I would’ve listened, but now I'm with somebody else...
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

Now it’s probably hard for you to hear,
But there’s nothing left for you to say...
Had my heart all in your hands - boy, what you don’t understand
Is a girl like me don’t have no time to waste around...

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it’d be different - if you spoke, I would’ve listened, but now I'm with somebody else...
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

(You’ll never know...) Boy, you should’ve told me, told me...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you should’ve let me know...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve been there for me,
But now, you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

It’s not my fault you’re a little bit too late;
You’re the only one to blame - Wipe that look off your face...
You can wish a thousand times, but none of that will change my mind, boy;
You had a chance you’ll never get back, get back...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know... oh, baby!

(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve told me, told me...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve let me know...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve been there for me...
But now, you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

(You’ll never know...) You will never know, you will never know, oh, baby...
(You’ll never know...) No...
(You’ll never know...)
You will never know! Ooh...</div>
Baby you're a wrecking ball
Crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall
Piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I'd never need you, baby

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong

Everybody's telling me
I'm over my head
If they don't feel you loving me
They all say that I've gone crazy
Maybe, but it's too late now to save
I'm too tangled

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Maybe it's not right
But that's all right
Yeah, it's all right tonight

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Even it's just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit twisted
Yeah
It's twisted
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
<div class="lyricbox">I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost 
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me 
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out 
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog 
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb 
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard 
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire 
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows 
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean rosé?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man</div>
Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin homie (Aye)
Look

[Chorus]
I aint never been nothin but a underdog
And I aint gonna neva let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

Just copped new shoes
Whip on two twos
Dick down you two
Throw it on youtube
Tell me what youd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal
Stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta Manana though
Hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it aint a city I aint never been
Scared I aint never been
Yea I aint never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under yall
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwears
Still in the hood yeah
I aint talking outer wear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cuz I'm with it
F**k yall the underdog

[Chorus x1]
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it aint a Buick
I never redezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the f**k you want to do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I f**k with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drive it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia
And coppertone
And girl I heard your man's a fed
Don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Aint one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city
Got it mobile like the lock is gone
Keys out
I aint talking white though
Baby what you be's bout
I mean for tonight ho
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

[Chorus x1]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh yeah
Listen, closely hear the music playing
Let it take you to places far away and
Relax your senses just do what you want to do
No need for questions
It's only for you
And it's so amazing
Oh how you can't escape it
The moon it takes you
And never let's you go

Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles it's alright
Let them go till we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun (the sun yeah)

So real
So right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings the life you needin
No need for stress, (no need for stress)
Let go another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say
And it's so amazing
On how you can't escape it
the moment takes you it never lets you Go!

Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there (let the rythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun (music of the sun)
Forget about your troubles it's alright
Let them go till we see the morning light (see the morning light)
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (come and dance with the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun (of the sun yeah)

And it's so amazing
Oh how you cant escape it
The moment takes you
And never let's you gooooooo

Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Join me, I deserved it
No time to have you lurking
If I got right then you might like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nobody touch me, I'm the righteous
Nobody text me in a crisis

I believed all of your dreams are fruition
You took my heart and my keys and my vision
You took my heart off my sleeve, a decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been

But I wake up and everything's wrong
Just get ready for work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work

Duh, duh, duh, duh
For you I got
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Before the tables turned, turned, turned, turned

Begging, something please
Baby, don't you leave
Don't leave me stuck here in the streets (no, no)

If I get another chance to
I will never, no never neglect you
I mean, who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this true
What can I say?
Please recognize I'm trying baby

I been work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
I work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done
That'll work, come over
We just need that slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one

Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over

Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me
Oh yeah, I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
How many more shots until you're rolling?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the

Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Work, work, work
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfections
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
and that's exactly what I mean.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line," ok
Made a million, off of denim
fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But thats was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me dont play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck wit' us and we don't fuck wit' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'mma make it last forever,
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

Hoe, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, needles it
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch

All Me. All Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking all that kush all in our section like its legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm less than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, touching they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do.
<div class="lyricbox">First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Missin' ya good intentions
Missin' ya from a distance
Hope ya did the same
I know that I caused a problem
I know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Sayin nothing gets you nowhere fast
I’mma hold it back inside

Well now that I'm back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Goin' through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothin' in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That’s what they used to say
'Cause goin to sleep alone at night
I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holdin' back this time

Now that I’m back around ya
Nothin around me matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

<div class="lyricbox">Si yo fuera un chico, 
sólo por una vez.
Yo me vestiría como quiero, 
con lo que vea primero y me voy.

Saldría a buscar,
chicas por montón.
Mis amigos que son leales,
siempre van acompañarme hasta el fin,
cada noche a mentir.

Si yo fuera un chico, 
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor,
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Si yo fuera un chico,
pero ves no lo soy.
Los chicos son de molde,
y nosotras somos de corazón.

Se piensan que son,
los del sexo superior.
Pero cuando lo queremos,
los vence nuestra seducción, seducción.

Si yo fuera un chico,
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor, 
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Es muy tarde, ya ves, para regresar.
Perdonarte otra vez,
ya no lo vas a lograr.
El lugar que ocupabas tu,
ya no está más.

Pero eres un chico, qué le vas hacer.
No puedes comprender,
que se siente al comprender mejor,
y amar en serio a una mujer.

No sabes escuchar.
No te importa el dolor.
Hasta que pierdes a quién quieres,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Pero eres un chico...</div>
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Daddy was mean ol' mister, mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister, she prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar, listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter, she called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
(Blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away

Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

[Chorus]:
Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in 
on your love scene
slow dancing
(you stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone

[Chorus]
Tell me how to forgive you
when it's me who's ashamed
and I wish I could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple-
he's the one to blame

Girl I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you love me
We let it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I felt victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl you're in your only
Rather be stuck in the night, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time

All the things you do, with thought of you
You-hoo-hoo, you-hoo-hoo
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you

Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
'Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
I told you once, get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright
But some things are better left unsaid

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands- )
(Put your hands up)

You tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid
<div class="lyricbox">Pageant Host/Harvey Keitel: "Miss Third Ward, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?"
Miss Third Ward/Beyoncé: "Hoh... my aspiration in life? Would be... to be happy."

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl;
What's in your head, it doesn't matter...
Brush your hair, fix your teeth;
What you wear is all that matters..."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Blonder hair, flat chest;
TV says, "Bigger is better..."
South Beach, sugar-free;
Vogue says, "Thinner is better...."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts... (Pretty hurts...)

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away;
The pain's inside, and nobody frees you from your body...
It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery;
It's my soul that needs surgery...

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far,
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors, and the shards of a beautiful girl...

Pretty hurts; (Oh, oh...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Pretty hurts...)
Perfection is a disease of a nation; (Pretty hurts...)
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Oh! Oh, oh...)
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see; (Pretty hurts...)
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

When you're alone all by yourself, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
and you're lying in your bed, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Reflection stares right into you; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
You stripped away the masquerade, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
The illusion has been shed; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)

Yes...</div>

[Verse 1 - Omarion] 
Even though you're all alone 
All I know when I am gone 
I just wanna keep you warm 
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back 

Yes, I'll be there 

Cause when I'm all alone 
I think about your face 
And how I wanna touch, 
I'm so far away (I'm Sooo) 

All I wanna do is give you all of me now 
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah 

[Chorus] 
don't go missing 
fly with me 
fly with me, fly with me 
fly with me 
check it out, check it out 
don't go missing 
fly with me, fly with me 

[Verse 2 - Drake] 
I'm aware that we just met 
I don't wanna leave you yet 
Promise that I won't forget 
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back 

Yes, I'll be there 

About to board the flight, 
Sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you 
But I'm so far away (I'm Sooo)

All I wanna do is give you all of me now 
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oooh 

[Chorus] 
don't go missing 
fly with me 
fly with me, fly with me 
fly with me 
check it out, check it out 
don't go missing 
fly with me, fly with me
You've got me
You've got me speechless

Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say
Yes, yes, yes, 
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless
[Drake - Verse 1] 
Money just changed everything 
I wonder how life without it would go 
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow? 
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below 
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago

Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit 
When I 'em hear talkin' 
I just don't know what to make of it 
Hate is so familiar to me 
I'm slowly embracing it

Doesn't come natural 
Bear wit' me it could take a bit 
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racin' with 
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it 
Wayne put me right here 
That's who I get the paper wit'

I hope that my success never alters our relationship 
Yeah, this life is somethin' I would die for 
October's Own, but it's lookin' like July 4 
I just wish they'd let you try it first 
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks 

[Chorus] 
Oh, today it begins 
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 
I keep having the same dream 
And I think that I just realized what it means 

[Alicia Keys] 
All I see is fireworks, 
All I see is fireworks 
Every night it's fireworks 
Every night it's fireworks

All I see is fireworks 
Taking off like fireworks 
Taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh 

[Drake - Verse 2] 
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me 
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery 
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me 
Who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily 

What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me 
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me 
And you makin' it seem that it happened that way because of me 
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious 

There was smoke in the air before now it's me clearin' it 
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though 
You never see it comin' you just get to see it go 
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first 
Now I can see it in her eyes 
Fireworks 

[Chorus] 
Oh, today it begins 
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 
I keep having the same dream 
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Drake - Verse 3] 
Everything the same but it feels different 
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen 
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin' 
It's been years, though, I just learned to deal with it

For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport 
Got my mother in a place with some better decor 
She searched the entire city I let her explore 
And now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before

How many of our parents' marriages lasted? 
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted 
I'm flyin' back home for the heritage classic 
Searchin' for that feelin', tell me where is the magic?

Let's stay together till we're ghosts 
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close 
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first 
Yhat's why I'm really goin' off, fireworks 

[Chorus]
Oh, today it begins 
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 
I keep having the same dream 
And I think that I just realized what it means
(What the heart wants...)
(The heart wants...)

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby...
Verse 1: Drake) 
My name is drizzy 
And I aint perfect 
And I work hard 
So I deserve it 
And I belong 
Right where you see me 
Aint on the fence about it 
I aint mister fenny 
I go a decent set of manners 
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner 
And I fall in love with girl 
Caugh up and superficial glammer 
Who dress like sara jessica 
And live like princess diana 
So often they have addiction 
And im the one who will feed it 
But truly you bad enough 
Where you don't really even need it 
You could show up to the party 
On dirty public transit 
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids 
Of you and your possie partying 
Drinking what you get handed 
With your virgin island tans 
All looking like you just landed 
I don't really understand it 
Im not sure im comprehending 
Cause these girls are having fun with who money they spending screaming 

(Chorus (2x)) 
I Got To Be Unstoppable (2x) 
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Like (2x) 

(Verse 2: Lil Wayne) 
My name is whezzy 
Im almost perfect 
And I work harder than hard working 
Bizarre circus 
That's what my bars surface 
There far I act a clown 
Even when I laying on my back im never backing down 
So over stand me 
I got a condo in miami 
And my door mat is always sandy 
And I run louisiana 
But I never pulled a hemi 
And I got a condo in atlanta 
And I always wear a bandany 
And when it come down to stunning 
You boys are just fronting 
And I swaging for the fence 
Your girl hanging from my dick 
Your girl singing to my shit like 
A li li lollipop 
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop 
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist 
Hold this 
Text me whenever you want some more dick 
More dick 
Old bitch 
Young bitch 
But I be like damn 
All I got is one dick 

(Chorus (2x)) 
I Got To Be Unstoppable (2x) 
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Like (2x)

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say "a guarantee"
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

I give you my all

You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let em fall through
I, I, I, I, I

I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry For You"
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

Yeah, okay, you like it
When I get, aggressive, tell you to
Go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

And I’m never on a waste ting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree

Knowing I'd lie for you
Thinking I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry For You"
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

Gyal a tear off mi garments
And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment (Woi!)
Di gyal dem want di length and strength
Action speak louder than argument well

But you can't just diss and come tell man sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story
Nah, it don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it
And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart, but she'd never wanna split a ting with me
But when it comes to you, you

I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

And I’m never on a waste ting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree
Jheeze!

Music a drop
Gyal a whine up dem bumpa
Dis is di summa summa controlla

Dah one yah a murda!

With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
It's really been weighing on me,
tell me what did I do?
To have ya'll hatin on me,
when I don't have nothin' to prove.
Sometimes I shake my head,
when I'm layin' down in my bed.
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
when you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.
You must admire me,
spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

It's really been weighing on me,
i'm not myself lately.
I feel a little incomplete,
but i'm not gonna lose no sleep.
I keep it all in my mind,
cause it gotta get better in time.
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.
You must admire me,
spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know,
yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
Why my name always in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...
[Drake]
All night I've, been starin
Can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open
There's nothin, I won't do oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Just thought you should know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh

[Chorus: Drake]
That's when you start to laugh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sayin I just want what I can't have (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Won't even give me a chance (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Claimin I'm just not as serious as you, shorty if you only knew
This is serious (serious)

[Drake]
Uhh..
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Chorus]
[instrumental w/ guitar solo for 34 seconds]
[Drake]
Hoh-whoa-ohh {*7X*}
<div class="lyricbox"><u>Mac Miller:</u>
What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top.
<u>
Ariana Grande:</u>
I love the way you make me feel;
I love it, I love it...

<u>Mac:</u>
Say... I’m thinking 'bout her every second, every hour,
Do my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,
"Do she love me, do she love me not?" (Love me not...)
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot... 

<u>Ariana:</u>
You give me that kind of something,
Want it all the time, need it every day...
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred;
Never get enough, I can’t stay away...

If you want it, I got it, I got it every day;
You can get whatever you need from me...
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you,
And I ain’t going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper

So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...
I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it... (Aye!)
And I don’t care who sees it, babe;
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...

I love the way (you make me feel,)
I love the way... (I love it, I love it...)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel,)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...

Ooh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin',
When you put your lips on mine
And honey, it's ain’t a question (q-question,)
'Cause boy, I know just what you like...

So If you need it, I got it, I got it every day;
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me...
Stay by your side! (I’ll never leave you...)
Said I ain’t going nowhere, 'cause you’re a keeper...

So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...
I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it... (Aye!)
And I don’t care who sees it, babe;
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me...

I love the way... (I love it, I love it...)
Baby, I love the way... (I love the way you make me feel,)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it...), the way I love you...

<u>Mac:</u>
Uh, I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine;
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind...
You’re a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time;
Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you’re sleeping in mine,
Come and watch a movie with me - “American Beauty” 
Or “Bruce Almighty” that's groovy, just come and move closer to me...
I got some feelings for you I’m not gonna get bored of,
But baby, you an adventure, so let me come and explore you...

<u>Ariana:</u>
So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...

I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)

When I'm here in your arms I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinchin' myself I don't care, I'm with you, you're with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams.

When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, 
Ohh

Let me know, if this is a dream, 
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you babe, (without you babe) ohh.
Let me know, if this is a dream, 
Then I ain't letting go, (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you babe, about you babe
So I rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, 
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
Is like I'm where I'm supposed to be.

When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, 
Ohh.

Let me know, if this is a dream,

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, 
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

It took a lot of time just to get to, to be with you baby
And now that I'm here with you I'm gonna take it in, breath you in
And if I'm dreaming let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I rather dream about you than be living life without me and you.
You

Let me know, if this is a dream, 
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you babe, (without you babe) ohh.

Yeah
There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go

Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin

It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize

Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
and felt our love begin

It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..
She says she met me on a tour
She keeps knocking on my door,
she won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong

'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, Maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines, on tv, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie girl
When ain't I never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You throw this, you throw this
Your foolness, seduces

Maria why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl
<div class="lyricbox">[Drake]
I said tell me what's really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I’m ready, what's happening
Gon for surgery but now I’m back again
I’m bout my paper like a muthfucking scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice

[Bun B]
Drake you got em right?

[Drake]
Yeah, I got em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ’s got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I’m in the city of the purple sprite
Someone tell Maliah I’m on fire she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell China it’d be worth the flight
I’ll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twirk something basis
She just try'na make it so she right here gettin naked
I don’t judge her, I don’t judge her
But I could never love her cause to her I’m just a rapper
And soon she’ll have met another
Thats why me and Lil' Jazz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I’m just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj
I told her I’d admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I’m fucking serious I’m with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the cameras always rollin’
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin’
Cause it’s on...

[Chorus]
Yeah girl it’s on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I’m gone
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I’m gone
And you just tell me what you down for
Anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Lil Wayne]
Oooh shit,
Muthafucker god damn
Kicking bitches out the Condo like Pam
Getting money everyday I’ma ground hog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don’t piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off
Erghhhh, thats nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make em run and tell your friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money Jerry Sloan
I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that’s how she learn every song
To the women I condone better write me when I’m gone
No I’m not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uhh, I’m a love machine
And I wont work for nobody but you
It’s only me and her cause the Bugatti coupe
Its blood gang slam but I party with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot
You don’t need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lining soup
And when I’m in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles, I am a group
Damn, I’ll be gone till November
But fuck it I ain't trippin, I know Drizzy gon’ kill em’
I’m sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama say it if the rules ain't bent don’t bend 'em
Real nigga talking
Shut the fuck up hoe
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, wattup Zoe
Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do’
Cause that’s where I bring it,
Soo wo if you banging, mothafucka

[Chorus - Drake]
Yeah girl it’s on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I’m gone
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I’m gone
And you just tell me what you down for
Anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone</div>

Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground 
Eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the Earth 
And I'm soaked in your love, love 
And love was right in my path, in my grasp 
And me and you belong 

I wanna run, run
Smash into you 

Ears closed, what I hear no one else has to know. 
Cause I know that what we have is worth first place in gold 
And I'm soaked in your love, love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp 
And me and you  belong 

I wanna run, run
Smash into you 
Smash into you

Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground 
Eyes shut, I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth 
And I'm soaked in your love, love 
And love is right in my path, in my grasp 
And me and you belong 

Oh, I wanna run 
Smash into you 
I'm willing to run, smash into you 
I'm willing to run and run and run and run 
R-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
R-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
And I wanna run, run 
Smash into you 
I'm willing to run, run
Smash into you
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?

Hold up, wait - before you go, just stay,
And talk to me for a little, baby, won't you loosen up just a little?
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Hold up, wait - shut up and kiss me, babe;
I just wanna get a little taste, I just wanna get a little taste before you go...
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Time and my trust - don't mess this up!
(You got me falling in love, you got me falling in love, you got me falling so hard...)
Boy, you change the way I breathe when you put your lips on me - I adore you,
So let me make it clear to you that, boy, you're all I need...
Oh, baby...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time... (Baby!)
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
I love you...

My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side... (You weren't by my side...)
You're my relation and connection to the sun; (Connection to the sun...)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome... (I can't overcome...)

With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully... (Grow so beautifully...)
Baby, I'm so proud, so proud to be your girl; (Proud to be your girl...)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and misty world...

I am in love with you - you set me free;

'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you;
I'll never leave - just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me,

'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you;

And I know you love me, love me for who I am, (Love me for who I am...)
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man... (Baby, you were my man...)
I know it ain't easy, easy lovin' me; (Easy lovin' me...)
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me... (From you to me...)
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child; (See myself having your child...)
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes... (Future in your eyes...)
The thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry; (Sometimes makes me cry...)
Realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side...

I am in love with you - you set me free; (I am in love...)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me, (I can't do this thing...)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you; (Without you...)
I'll never leave - just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me, (I love you...)
'Cause I am in love with you - you set me free; (I'm so in love...)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me, (I can't do this thing, life without you...)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you; (Oh... no, no, no...)
I'll never leave - just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me... (Keep lovin' me... lovin' me...)

Every time I see your face, my heart smiles every time;
It feels so good it hurts, sometimes...
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you...
Dangerously in love, yeah, yeah...

I am in love with you - you set me free;
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me, (Can't do this thing, yeah...)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you; (I love you, I love you, I love you, I'll never leave!)
I'll never leave - just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me, (Keep lovin' me, oh...)
'Cause I am in love with you - you set me free; (I'm in love with you! I'm in love with you!)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me, (I cannot do... I cannot do this thing without you in my life...)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you;

Dangerously in love...
[Drake:]
Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[Drake:]
Uh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'm a take this hat off, and I'm a hit it till I backs off
And then I'm back sorrowful
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Chorus]
[Phonte:]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon

[Chorus]
[Elzhi:]
They say you never judge a book by it's cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by it's cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Chorus]
Justin Bieber
This is the time of year
We can give it, give it, give it, give it all
1 thru 10 on your list
You can get it, get it, get it, get it all
Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right there

Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber
Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night oooh
When I put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time

Boyz II Men
You got on my favorite dress
And you're lookin, lookin, lookin good oh
Snow fallin on your hair
And I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift

Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber
Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, oooh
When I put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time

Justin Bieber and Boyz II Men
I'm gonna deck your heart with boughs of holly (boughs of holly)
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Baby 'cause you're the reason to be jolly

Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber
I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Christmas
I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la, la, fa la la

You've been on my mind, I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go, you're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

If I've been on your mind, you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go? 

I don't know why I'm scared, 'cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it, nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places, fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times... I have committed

Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing

What kids are doing, are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free

Yeah, am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay

Fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

(I'll fake you out)
And I'll fall
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break
And I'll fake
(And I'll break you down)
All I wanna

I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

All I wanna
(And I'll fake you out)
Yeah, and I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
(And I'll break you down)

All I wanna
(I'll fake you out)
Yeah, and I'll fall down
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
(And I'll break you down)

All I wanna
I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space
(verse 1) 
What's up? 
I know we haven't spoken for a while 
But I was thinkin' 'bout you 
And it kinda made me smile 
So many things to say 
And I'll put 'em in a letter 
And it might be easier 
The words might come out better 
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
Does he still look just like you? 
So many things I wanna know the answers to 
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line 
To the story of me and you 

(chorus) 
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose 
Hope to hear from you soon 
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you 

(verse 2) 
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on 
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone 
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me 
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me 
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the T.V. 
Boy it ain't easy 
When I hear our song 
I get that same old feeling 
Wish I could press rewind 
Turn back the hands of time 
And I shouldn't be telling you

(chorus) 
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose 
Hope to hear from you soon 
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you 

Did you know I kept all of your pictures 
Don't have the strength to part with them yet 
Oh no 
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste 
But some things a girl can never forget 

(chorus) 
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose 
Hope to hear from you soon 
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
<div class="lyricbox">I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure

How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 A.M. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure</div>
Southern Smoke!!!

[Speaking]
Yeah. Ho! 
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

[Chorus:]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1:]
Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw,
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more 
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Chorus: (x2)]
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2:]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

[Chorus: (x2)]
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Outro: (x2)]
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance,
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

[Talking]
Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters
Drake, It's Southern Smoke
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around

I guess it's right
It's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)
(Take me to that place you cry from)
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you, dear?
Is there anyone I could call?
No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, oh

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

Before your love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here (here, here, yeahhh)

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?  (do you understand?)
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

I can't imagine life without your touch,
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'

I'm gonna hold it down for you
You, whoa, oh, whoa
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah whoa

I don't wanna to go back
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again

Uh-huh uh-huh (Shia, Rihanna)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Ho)
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain
I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me
In anticipation
For precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay
Rain man is back
With little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

Rihanna
You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come in to me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, imma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

It's raining, raining
Ooh baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come in to me
Come in to me
It's raining, raining
Ooh baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come here to me
Come in to me

It's pouring rain, it's pouring rain
Come in to me, come in to me
Come in to me, come in to me</div>
Wise men say
"Only fools rush in"
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be, oh

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

But I can't help
Falling in love with you
[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look,
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin
Because They Swimmin In Women
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors
They Come In Secret Flavors
Thats Why I Envy Omar
Because So Far

And Thats Some Higher Learning
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot
With The Tires Burnin
And Im A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith
In Any Female Thats Askin What I Was Earnin
I Met This Recent Lady
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy
Now Im Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately
Im All Alone, I Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces
Circling Workplaces
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is
They Get To First Bases
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin
He Wanna Know What The First Trace Is
Now You Like Macgyver
Cuz You Sneakin Around
And She Dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her
I Cant Relate To That
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact

I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It
With [?] And They Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In
And In The End I Listen But I Dont See Me As They Do
Cuz Its My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls
Either Way Im All Alone, Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone

[Verse 3: Drake]
Check,
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet
But Theres Logic Behind It
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It
I Tend To Freak With This
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss
Thinkin She Been Spoiled
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days
And Come Up With Tin Foil

We Could Dissect It See
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing
Gave Her Nothing
Her Reputations In Jeopardy
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling Im Wrong
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone

Ruby I hope I see you, I've waited all this week
For you to walk my way, your soul will capture me
Your momma painted your room a shade of pink, she said
But with your great arrival that shade has turned to red.

Ruby take my hand, please lead me to the Promised Land
Tell me, where am I from, your eyes say, "Shada de da dum."
Ruby, you're royalty, in your homeland, they all call you "Queen"
Tell me, where are you from, your eyes say, "Shada de da dum."

You're an angel fallen down, won't you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky, how high? how high?

You're true and pure
You hold the cure
We're all diseased
You hold the key.
Tell our dad, "I'm sorry."

"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you?
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl

But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My heart belongs to you
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then

But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My hearts belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...

No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
I will always love you
Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby I'm all set
We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on, we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost I'll be good with that
Yeah we'll find a way to make the time pass
Window rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holding my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All of our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Yeah, let's just get out of this town
Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
Oh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah, standin' ovation
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (ooh oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (ooh oh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow, uh oh oh

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
Ya better hurry up before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talkin' 'bout, "Girl I love you, you're the one."
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is on?

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (mmm)
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught (mmm)

But you put on quite a show (ooh oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (ooh oh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you
(Goes to you)
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out

How 'bout a round of applause?
A standin' ovation

But you put on quite a show (ooh oh)
Really had me going
Now it's time to go (ooh oh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

But it's over now...
He stays home home for work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie but this time he decides that it's alright.
It's alright.
No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize before.
He goes to lock the door.

He is falling
And though he knows it's not
The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

We all need you now.
Someone said where you going
Someone said to you goodbye
They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the time.
We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.
And we blame it on the times.

Oh he is falling
And though he knows it's not
The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

We all need you now
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.
Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

Verse 1:
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (baby)
If you let him take me from you

Verse 2:
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see

If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (baby)
If you let him take me from you

Bridge:
Boy when i try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
Thats when its cool
But baby boy i'm not a fool

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
You never wanted me (wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (no no)
That your love was never true (no no)
If you let him take me from you 
(how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you

I guess i finally see
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)
That your love was never true (let me go)
If you let him take me from you (just let me kno)
If you let him take me from you
Sell me candy like the summer when it's melting in my hand
I know you're around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling whisper something in my ear
Say it like sugar tell me what I wanna hear

I'm weak by your touch when it's meltin' on my lips
A rush through my body, feel it in my finger tips
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good, spoil me rotten to the core
Come on

(Chorus:)
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak
Baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
I'm the daddy! You the boss!

Be a professional, boy you make a sale
Try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta enjoy
You're running through my garden now you're knocking at my door
Forbidden little kiss and you call it bittersweet
The shorty that u rocking wit ain't nothing like me 
You're selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
Sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core
You know

(Chorus:)
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak
Baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
I'm the daddy! You the boss!

I want you babe
More than you know
So don't you leave and don't you go
I want it all, until time falls
These arms, won't hold you wrong
I want your love, give you my trust
I wanna live for both of us
I wanna breathe ya, lay on shoulder
I wanna warm ya, when nights get colder

I want love, love, love
love love..

(Chorus:)
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak
Baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
I'm the daddy! You the boss!
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like puttin' fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried 'bout
Ooh you know females
And how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood (don't change your mood)

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, sometimes be your best friend
Perfect - ain't saying that I am
Proven, least I'm provin' that I give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I outta be to you, to you
Envy, envy
Same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad
(I ain't all bad)
R.I.P to the girl you used to see 
her days are over 
baby shes over 
I've decided to give you all of me 
baby come closer 
I'm ready for ya! 
Kill 'em all, switch it up, 
put it on, zip it up 
Let my perfume soak it in your sweater, 
say you'll be here soon, sooner the better 
No option for you saying 'no'. 
I run this game, just play your role 
Follow my lead, whatchu waiting for? 
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night 

CHORUS 
Yeah i hear you talkin don't know who your tryin to flatter

I-ohoh, I-I-I'm ready for ya 
I-ohoh, so keep thinkin your the man cause thats all part of my plan, 
I-I-I'm ready for ya 

Nothin on, I strut around, I do it big, I shut it down 
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me 
Mental pictures, no cameras please 

CHORUS 
Red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash 
Black loungeray, white diamonds what a contrast 

I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast, define fast 
Cause I could speed it up and make it last 
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast 
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past 
And make damn sure that you never forget it, 
admitt it 
I'm ready 
I'm wit it 
Still here like a statue pink champaigne 
Green ink in your tattoos 
You say you got baggage well I'm packed too 
Plus i got a sex pistol pointed right at you 
BANG 
The baddest woman ever and the hardest ????? 
proven over and over again thats why I'm hard to doubt 
plus I'm young money till death 
I took the carter out 
I'm more then ready too, hope it's somethin you thought about 

I-I-I'm ready for ya 
CHORUS 
R.I.P to the girl you used to see

I'm calling out your name, but you're not listening
'Cause you're staring into space again
Hey, are you dreaming of a life that seems a little better?
Are you thinking that maybe you made the wrong decision?
It's the one thing I didn't want this to be
No the one thing I didn't want this to be

Honey if you wanna be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

It's tearing me apart to see you like this
With your head in your hands, only a shadow of the person I miss
You're asking how I can like this, don't even like myself
Asking how can I be here, wish I were somewhere else
It's the one thing I didn't want this to be
No the one thing I didn't want this to be

Honey if you wanna be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

When did I become the opposition?
Why do I deserve this quarantine?
When I'm fighting hard to get back to you
I'm confused by what your silence means
When you've built your home in troubled waters
When did I become the predator,
When I'm throwing you a line here, darling?
And I'm begging you to save yourself
Yeah I'm begging you to save, save, save yourself

Yeah if you wanna be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

Be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

And put a smile on your face,

If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah.
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh.

You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry⬧
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind, no.

And I know it's never gonna be that easy

Right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time 
Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well, I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
You walked in, caught my attention;
I've never seen a man with so much dimension...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,

Now I can't wait to hold you in my arms;
I know I was made for you - I'm in love with all your charm...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,

Well, I want you - got to have it,
And I need you like I never have loved before...
Oh, I want you - ooh, I need you;
Got to have you like I never had lovin' before...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
Hey babe it's me, I just wanted to call to tell you that
I love you so so so so much,
Just wanted to let you know that you are my princess,
You are worthy of all of the love in the world,
You are the love of my life.

Now's all we got,
And time can't be bought,
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember

You said you loved me,
I said I loved you back,
What happened to that?

All your promises,
And all them plans we had,
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember

The trips we dream of takin',
The tags left on the map,
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing,
When all we did was laugh,
What happened? what happened?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember 

Break down the walls,
Let heaven in,
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again,
We used to be inseparable,
I used to think that I was irreplaceable,
We lit the whole world up,
Before we blew it up,
I just don't know how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember 
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can you keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
'Cause...

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you

Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

I don't want nothing else
Not when I had the best
Because you showed me the best

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself "why do you worry?"
You know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Drake - Verse 1]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Hook]
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Drake - Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together -- I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got 10 years to go huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right

Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story of just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh

I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah

I love to see you walk into the room 
Body shining, lightin' up in the place 
And when you talk everybody stop 
'Cuz they know you know just what to say and 
The way that you protect your friends 
Baby, I respect you for that 
And when you roll you take everyone you love along 
I love that shit

Don't fly me away 
You don't need to buy a diamond key 
To unlock my heart 
You shelter my soul 
You're my fire when I'm cold 
I want you to know... 

You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
You had me at hello (Hello) 
It was many years ago (Ago) 
Baby, when you, stole my cool (stole my cool) 
Cuz you had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
Hello oooooh 

I get so excited when you travel with me, baby, while I'm on my grind 
And never will I ever let my hustle come between me and my family time and... 
You keep me humble out of this hype 
'Cuz you know there's more to life 
And if I need ya, you will be here, you will make the sacrifice 

Don't fly me away 
You don't need to buy a diamond key 
To unlock my heart 
You shelter my soul 
You're my fire when I'm cold 
I want you to know... 

You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
You had me at hello (Hello) 
It was many years ago (Ago) 
Baby, when you stole my cool (stole my cool)
You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
Hello oooooh 

Gotta feel you
And be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you
Wanna show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so... hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same

You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
You had me at hello (Hello) 
It was many years ago (Ago) 
When you stole my cool (stole my cool)
You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello)
Hello oooooh

It was many years ago 
Baby, when you stole my cool 
You had me at hello 
Hello 
Hello oooooh
Last night I got served a little bit too much
Of that poison, baby
Last night I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor 
And I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name

We left the club right around 3 o'clock 
In the morning
His Pinto sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

Today, I woke up
Thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
Outta nowhere
I gotta go 
Take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here
All of this will disappear
There's just one little problem:

I don't even know my last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done? What have I done? What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh yeah
<div class="lyricbox">I'm more than just an option
Hey, hey, hey
Refused to be forgotten
I took a chance with my heart
And I feel it taking over

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I’m more than just a number
Hey, hey, hey
I doubt you’ll find another
So every single summer
I'll be the one that you remember

And I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It’s more than just a mission
Hey, hey, hey
You hear but you don’t listen
You better pay attention
And get what you been missing

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I’ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I’m done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart</div>
<div class="lyricbox">What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn’t
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven
It seems like you don’t want this love anymore
I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love</div>
One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in its path
Thinking that you might get off for that

I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time

I'll move on, baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you

I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end it wasen't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow

I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but i'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you

Oh, oh, someday
Oh, someday

I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
Oh, oh
<div class="lyricbox">Cameras
[Verse 1]
Word on road, it's the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

[Hook]
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)

[Verse 2]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB (ah)

[Bridge]
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

[Hook]
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)

[Verse 3]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)

[Bridge]
[Outro]
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)

Good Ones Go
[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Summer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'm gonna need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
Should be tired of taking care of me right now

[Hook]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2]
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

[Hook]</div>
Would of came back for you
I just needed time
To do what I have to do
Caught in a life
I can't let it go, whether that's right
I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and waited to long
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back...

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gay shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Bad
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains
The seats for these Heat games
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Would of came back for you
I just needed time
To do what I have to do
Caught in a life
I can't let it go, whether that's right
I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and I waited to long
But I woulda came back, woulda came back...
La la la la
La la la la (oh yeah)

I want you to love me
Like I'm a hot ride
Be thinkin' of me
Doin' what you like

So boy, forget about the world
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it
Then I'mma make you swallow your pride

Want you to make me feel

Hold me like a pillow
Make me feel right

Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'
You can come inside (yeah)
And when you enter, you ain't leavin'
Be my prisoner for the night, oh

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world

I met him on my birthday

He was a present to me from the stars
They all said "Happy Birthday, girl"
Then they tore my world apart.
They put me on the east side
And they left him in L.A.
The distance grew between us
And we broke up yesterday
But if I cry myself a river, I can swim back to my sweet California
Give me a
C - A - L - I
I never knew I could feel like that
F - O - R - N
Anyone could tell you that I've got it bad
I - A, I - A, 
I ain't going down this way
I'm gonna cry myself a river so I can swim back to my sweet California
They're telling me I cry too much
That I could fill every bath and sink
In this city I got stuck in
With its tragic symphonies
They warned me not to get attached
But they got to me way too late
'Cause I'm thinking of him constantly-
Every moment I'm awake
But if I cry myself a river, then I can swim back to my sweet California
Give me a
C - A - L - I
I never knew I could feel like that
F - O - R - N
Anyone could tell you that I got it bad
I - A, I - A, 
I ain't going down this way
I'm gonna cry myself a river, then I can swim back to my sweet California
Cold water bring me back to my senses
Cold water, let me drown in him
Cold water, bring me back to my senses
Cold water, bring me back to him
Oh give me a
C - A - L - I
I never knew I could feel like that
F - O - R - N
Anyone could tell you that I got it bad
I - A, I - A, 
I ain't going down this way
I'm gonna cry myself a river so I can swim back to my sweet California

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home (to come home)

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy

Ariana:
Keep your hands on me
Don't take them off 
Until I say so 
Let me break you off
We'll be taking off
Or maybe making love
You just keep your eyes on my you know what

Trembling, when you touch
Rush is racing, body baking
Picture me and you making
Making sweet love
Baby give it to me

Eyes on me, dance on me tonight
Your all, all on me
Keep your hands on me

Don't take them off

Bubble big got a parachute to land on it
Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?

It's your birthday
Every day with me
And my maker hard rock A-S-A-P
Got me talking marriage
I like what I see
And might put a ring on it
Word to B and Jay-Z
But before I do that let me put a hand on it

[Verse 1:]
It's a celebration, clap clap bravo,
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this...yea, and he was just practice.
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better,
And she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.

Ayo, ayo, ayo....[repeat 4x]
[Verse 2:]
This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder,
Clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl...and your mistakes are costin, girl...
And maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
to take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

River Lea, River Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore
Just when you think it's lost in the rain
It comes back knocking at your door

It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around

God put us here on this carnival ride
We close our eyes
Never knowing where it will take us next
Babies are born and at the same time, 
Someone's taking their last breath

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around

In the blink of an eye
It can change your life
And it never even slows down

It's the wheel of the world
I don't know what it is
I'm flying high
Then I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
Life keeps on moving anyway

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
It's the wheel of the world turning around

It can open your heart
It can break you apart
And it never even slows down

It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
(I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you)
(Let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself)

Lookin' in your eyes
Makes me wonder how
I got so much time
With you and there's more around
I know all the competition after to you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

That we're living
In a fairytale, no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside you is only mine

That's how I know
I can't be your only one 
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't
I can't be your only one
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget it, yeah

As I'm laying down, with you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairytale, no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one 
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't
I can't be your only one
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't

(Only one)
(Be your only one)
We break, break 
We  break 'em down 

We break, break 
We break 'em down 

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious 
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious 
'Cause the beat penetrates my body 
Shaking inside my bones 
And you pushin all my buttons, taking me outta my zone, yeah 

The way that you stare, starts a fire in me 
Come up to my room you, sexy little thing 
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease 
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing 

(chorus:) (2x) 
I wish you would push up on it 
I wish you would light me up and say you want me push up on me 

I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident 
Got so much flavour with you but you the perfect man 
You wanna make me chase ya like it's a compliment 
But let's get right down to it 
I can be the girl that'll break you down 

The way that you stare, starts a fire in me 
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing 
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease 
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing 

(chorus:) (2x) 
I wish you would push up on it 
I wish you would light me up and say you want me push up on me 

We break, break 
We break 'em down 

We break, break 
We break 'em down 

I wanna see how you move it 
Show me, show me how you do it 
You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess) 
Baby there ain't nothing to it 
Baby who you think you're fooling 
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh... 

The way that you stare, starts a fire in me 
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing (Sexy little thing) 
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease (Oh baby) 
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing 

(chorus:) (2x) 
I wish you would push up on it (I wish you would) 
I wish you would light me up and you say you want me push up on me 

We break, break 
We break 'em down 

We break, break 
We break 'em down
I wanna fall inside your ghost 
And fill up every hole inside my mind 
And I want everyone to know 
That I am half a soul 
Divided 

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away 
Either way you're by my side until my dying days 
And if I'm not there and I'm far away 
I said, "Don't be afraid." 
We're going home. 

I wanna strip myself of breath 
A breathless beast of death I've made for you 
A mortal writing piece of song 
Will help me carry on 
But these you heard 

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away 
Either way you're by my side until my dying days 
And if I'm not there and I'm far away 
I said, "Don't be afraid." 
We're going home. 

So the hearse ran out of gas 
A passenger purse and grabbed a map 
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past 
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab 
A beautifully planned taxi cab 
A cab, had it cleared out back 
And two men started to unpack 

Driving once again 
But now this time there were three men 
And then I heard one of them say 
"I know the night will turn to gray 
I know the stars will start to fade 
When all the darkness fades away 
We had to steal him from his fate 
So he could see another day 

Then I cracked open my box 
Someone must have picked the lock 
A little light revealed the spot 
Where my fingernails had fought 
Then I pushed it open more, 
Pushing up against the door 
Then I sat up off the floor 
And found the brother we're searching for 

Then there were three men up front 
All I saw were backs of heads 
And then I asked them am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead 
And then one turned around to say, 
"We're driving toward the morning sun 
Where all your blood is washed away 
And all you did will be undone." 

I said, "Don't be afraid."
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives 
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her 

These days, when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied

You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her 
You shower me with words made of knives 

Time and time again I'll play the role of fools (just for you) 
Even in the daylight when you're dreaming (I'm close to you) 
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Even though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives 
Justin Bieber
This is the time of year
We can give it, give it, give it, give it all
1 thru 10 on your list
You can get it, get it, get it, get it all
Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right there

Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber
Baby you deserve everything you want

That's how I know that it's Christmas time

Boyz II Men

Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift

Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber
Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, oooh
When I put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats

Boyz II Men and Justin Bieber

Fa la la, la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me
(like fa la la, la, fa la la)
That's how I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la, la, fa la la
Christmas
That's how I know it's Christmas time
Fa la la, la, fa la la
One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
So then I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damn
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
Is why I gotta ask... 

is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn
I cant even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
This why I gotta ask, 

is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new 

Is anything I'm doing brand (new(6x))
Or is everything I'm doing too (late(6x))

Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?

is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Show me if this is brand new?

yeah, yeah yeah...
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you, and boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it (rumour)


She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it (rumour)


All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it (rumour)



But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for
Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yea... Can ya'll hear me out there
It's a lovely night tonight ain't it
Yea I know

You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real

I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yea
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town
And I know if I see you garaunteed it's goin down

That's the craziest part rite?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&amp;B on you know

With the slit at the top so

I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talkin bout

I don't know I'll think of it
Hey!
Hahaha

Ho!
Oh well nigga fuck that hoe!
Goddamn

Uh huh
It's Iggy Iggz!
I got one more problem with you, girl
(One less, one less problem)
Aye!

Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya (I want you-hou-hou)
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to (I want you-hou-hou)

Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it (I want you-hou-hou)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up (but it's you-hou-hou)
I know I shouldn't never call back
Or let you come back (but it's you-hou-hou)

Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it (but it's you-hou-hou)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

It's Iggy Iggz
Uh, what you got?

Smart money, bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you

Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson

No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million yous baby boy, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what!

One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I am too easily blown away
And too easily lead astray
By a boy got that look in his eye
I get too stupid to run from the heat
Too dizzy to land on my feet
He's making the room spin
Dont know what i'm thinkin
Tonight
I'm dubbing headfirst into somethin
Better judgement's gone a runnin
Tonight, tonight

Nothing but trouble on his mind, 
I come across it all the time
Not getting smarter from it
Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this

E-e-easy completely, e-e-easy
He is selling me all the right stuff,
I'm sure that i cant get anough
That boy's got that look in his eyes
Well he has total control over me,
I'm falling right down at his feet
I'm drunk and i'm laughin,
Its making the room spin,
Tonight
I'm dubbing headfirst into somethin
Better judgement's gone a runnin
I'm headin straight into disaster
We all know what he is after
Tonight, tonight

Nothing but trouble on his mind, 
I come across it all the time
Not getting smarter from it
Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this
Kick myself for getting like this

E-e-easy, completely e-e-easy
Completely e-e-easy, completely e-e-easy, 
Completely e-e-easy, completely e-e-easy,
Completely e-e-easy, e-e-easy, 

Nothing but trouble on his mind, 
I come across it all the time
Not getting smarter from it
Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this

Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this

Ooh Yeah 
Yeah yea

(Verse 1)
When you stand so close to me
Im feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

(Chorus)
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to 
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)

(Verse 2)
My bestfriends tell me Rihanna

But it's written on my face

Dance floor, feeling so at ease.
*There are 37 boys on her

Disaster and nothing ever gets past her.

What goes around comes back around 
Hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around
I say, what goes around comes back around
What goes around comes back around

There was a time
I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been outta my mind

So when I think of the time that I
Almost loved you
You showed your ass and I
I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
So baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the
And I'm gon' always be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh, yeah
I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time
That I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And baby, yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Said, you turned out to be the
Hmm, and I'll never be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh baby, I bet
Sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one who's got away
Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God
I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
So through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the
And I will always be the
(Best thing you never had)
Ooh best thing you never had

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the
Oh, I will never be the
(Best thing you never had)
Oh, baby
I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone

And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know
What that means, I know

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat

But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then, you'll never understand

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

We've turned our hands to guns
Trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you
Of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers
To my head

The solution is
I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest
And this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them
To turn their guns to a fist

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
<div class="lyricbox">Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry
'Cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again

Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah yeah

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Till I see you again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Till I see you again yeah yeah yeah whoa
Till I see you again
Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone.</div>
Yee-haw
Texas, Texas, Texas

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
'Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
(Good job Bey, hahaha)
So girl
You just be honest with me, I know we can make this work
I love you

I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all, give it all to you

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Only wanna live it with you

Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it happen, [?]
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than a mission

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all, give it all to you

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Only wanna live it with you

If I came to your crib would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Only wanna live it with you
I'll love you 'til I die, boy, every day of my life;
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you, not just on Christmas...
Wanna show you in so many ways, three-hundred-sixty-five days;
I'll give you all my presents, boy, I'm for you, not just on Christmas...

Baby, whether rain or shine, naughty or nice, I'm by your side...
I'll love you 'til I die, boy, every day of my life;
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you, not just on Christmas...

Baby, whether rain or shine, naughty or nice, I'm by your side...
Oh, oh oh ohoh
(And I pray)

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Ooh, I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray yeah
I close my eyes and...

I pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls that need a break
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (and I pray)
I close my eyes and I pray (oh)
ohohoh

I pray (oh, and I pray)
I pray

I close my eyes and pray
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me
Must be yo mission 
'Cause with every hug and kiss 
You're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable 
And it's a heartbreaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do, 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right take me high
Then that high, it subsides 
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive 
Wait, wait, wait... I'm alive
But how long will it last 
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No), it's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself, this can't do (Can't do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)
It's so unfair, (Unfair) that I find myself right back in your care (Care)
And what's good is that when you are not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Baby kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, ooh
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die
Didn't I give it all, tried my best?
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here

But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily, I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is for you

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad
It cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain

'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me, I might just your heal
You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing

Talk about when we were children
Not the kinda kid that you believe in
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
Yeah you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

You saw me on a television
Hanging on my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit you shake your head at my decision

I guess the kinda songs that I been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah you saw on a television

But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it, yeah
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

Oh you know me, I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody falling in love
Oh you know me, everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck

And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah this the life I live
And that's just the half of it

Yeah you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the half of it, hey, no...

You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television
Justin Bieber
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Usher
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
Both
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase (oh wooah)
To kids from one to ninety-two (yeah, yeah)
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas (yeah), Merry Christmas (oh no)
Merry Christmas to you
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh

Oh, no
Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Satellites flashing by...

It's a beautiful state we're in, but how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try...

We're nothing like we seem - passionate words are never spoken;
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side...

In your eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

Take all the rules away - how can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display - let's run and hide...

In our eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space...
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe...

Satellites flashing by...
Satellites...
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to bein' alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that'll never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face:

"This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know 
This is my temporary home..."

Young mom on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a halfway house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we'll find our place here in this world..."

"This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know 
This is our temporary home..."

Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers:
"Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday..."
He looks up and says, "I can see God's face..."

"This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know 
This was my temporary home..."

This is our temporary home

Oh oh
Oh ohhh

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight
Through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears? Oh whoa
So far away and now I just need you here

So we'll fight
Through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh

We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
To get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses dripping in diamonds, sipping on champagne
She was all uptown wearing that white gown, taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises covered in make-up, dark sunglasses
And that next morning sitting in the back pew praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee Whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery 
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
Yeah
Whoa
Gunfire left a hole
In the tank
Losing gasoline

Fire is on my trail
And he's after me
Hope it don't get here
Before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breath

You could've been a apart of a
Masterpiece
Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going
I don't need my breaks
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb

Scenes go
But baby no
Doesn't have to be
Microwaving a medal tragedy
Watching it burn and
It's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful
When it's through
It's the other half of me

I didn't do it
You lit the match for me
Now were flying
From the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where were going
We don't need no breaks
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb

Baby we were killing them
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing
And

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

She know it, it a no big
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man
No bomboclat, otha
And if a boy nuh like
OVO crew my nigga can just suck ya motha
With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO unruly

With my woes
Eighteen years had come and gone 
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loadin' up that Chevy

Both tryin' not to cry
Mama kept on talkin' puttin' off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
Baby don't forget

Before you hit the highway you better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray in case you run short on cash
Here's a map and here's a Bible if you ever lose your way
Just one more thing before you leave
Don't forget to remember me

This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep tellin' me I'm on my own
Just like every Sunday I called mama up last night
And even when it's not I tell her everything's all right
Before we hung up I said 
Hey mama don't forget

To tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall
Tell mee-maw that I miss her yeah I should give her a call
And make sure that you tell daddy that I'm still his little girl
Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me

Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray
Haven't done this in a while so I don't know what to say
But Lord I feel so small sometimes in this big old place
Yeah I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me
Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Raekwon
Visual visual JB
Yo Ye whattup
Raekwon

You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta

Justin Bieber
You see my baby over here
Hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
What you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Kanye West
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine

Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I (oh I) I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah)

Raekwon
Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this b*tch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh baby
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
<div class="lyricbox">Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out, make you think it’s real
Funny how love can make you feel, yeah

Ouh, ouh, yeah
I just can’t leave love alone
Hey!

Ain’t it funny how love can make you fly
Sweetest buzz and the highest high
When you can’t walk to the other side
Ain’t it funny how love can make you fly

Ouh, I can’t stop it
Ouh, gotta have it, want it,
I can’t help it
I just can’t leave love alone
(Can’t leave it alone)
Hey!

Oh come on!
Burn me once but it don’t sink in
I just keep coming back again
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave, I can’t leave it
I can’t leave it alone
I can’t leave it</div>
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought

You and me would stop this love drought
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
A gift (a gift) from Virgo... (Virgo...)
Oh... (Virgo...)

I wish I could look in your eyes, and tell you how I feel right now, inside;
Baby, I know that it's real (real), so real (real), so real (real), so real...

Mmm... (Miss you...)
How I wish I could be with you...
(I miss you...)
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now...

Every morning, every afternoon, every night, I wanna be with you;
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in a hotel room all day,
I just wanna be with you...
I love everything about you, from your old-school tennis shoes, 
to the way you move when you're dancing with me...

Do you remember our first kiss? It wasn't long enough...
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together? They were not long enough...
All of our conversations, all of your sweet pages, they're never long enough...

When it's time for me to leave, it's so hard to say good-bye;
I never want to say good-bye... I never ever want to say good-bye...

One day, we'll make love;
Finally, I'll be yours...
Only you, only you - I could love you...
But it's too late: I already love you...
I love you (I love you), I love you (I love you), I love you... (I love you...)
Yeah, I get it
I get it
Yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah

Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular (?) they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim

(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

(VERSE 2:)
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down
KyanaL
Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you
What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
I wanna know
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh baby, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
This was all you
None of it me
You put your hands all 
Over my body and told me
Mmm... you told me you were ready
For the big one
For the big jump
I'd be your last love 
Everlasting you and me
Mmm... that was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...

I was too strong
You were trembling
You couldn't handle
The hot heat rising 
(Rising)
Mmm... baby, I'm so rising
I was running
You were walking
You couldn't keep up
You were falling down
(Down)
Mmm... there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh...

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
Are you ready? 
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

I kiss you when you lick your lips, I kiss you when you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I

Must be good to you

Verse 1.

I Feel Good, I Got Some Time Off Girl It's Been So Long,
Did You Have Fun, Cause I'ma Need A Cab Just To Get Me Home,

I Know, I Know I'm Blunt But How Real Is That, You Want That Feeling' Back,
Then You Should Know.

Chorus.
I Still Got It For Ya' (x6)
And Even Though We Let It Go, It's Better That You Know,
And Even Though We Let It Go, It's Better That You Know, I Still.

Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too

You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette

Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye

Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am
I look at you, and all I wanna do, is just disappear
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get out of here
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know my heart

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover,
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for
And she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
She can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this live
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Why can I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see, how good this can be
I hope she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side
Cause she gets the light that is in me
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
You're everything I thought you never were 
And nothing like I thought you could've been 
But still you lived inside of me 
So tell me how is that 

You're the only one I wish I could forget 
The only one I loved and not forgive 
And though you've break my heart 
You're the only one 

And though there are times when I hate you 
Cause I can't erase 
The times that you hurt me 
And put tears on my face 
And even now I hate you it pains me to say 
I know I'll be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl, no no 
No broken-hearted girl 

I'm no broken-hearted girl 
There's something that I feel I need to say 
But up 'til now I've always been afraid 
That you would never come around 
And still I wanna put this out 
You say you got the most respect for me 
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me 
And still you're in my heart 
But you're the only one 

And yes there are times when I hate you 
But I don't complain 
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away 
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say 
That I will be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you babe 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh 
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah 
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free 
To spread my wings and fly away 
Away without you
 
Yeah yeah yeah, oh ohh... 

I don't wanna be without my baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 
Broken-hearted girl, no, no 
No broken-hearted girl 
No broken-hearted girl
I love you, need you
Need you to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Is this what you want? The baddest, the baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, have to have it, hit it twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed Imma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer

When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Super power
A subtle power
A tough love
Like a shark
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power

Super power
A subtle power
A tough love
Like a shark
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
No I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
'Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable

Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone (oh no)
Didn't waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
'Cause I was out of line (oh, yeah)

But I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl

It was a bad day (hey, yeah, yeah)
I know I was wrong
But you could have said "goodbye" baby
It was a bad day
Now I'm like, "wow"

It was a bad day
I'm so into you
I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do
Is to fall in deep

But close ain't close enough
'Til we cross the line
So name a game to play
And I'll roll the dice

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watching us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

This could take some time
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watching us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watching us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Justin Bieber
As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me

Big Sean
Yo, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it, I'll fly you to it
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me
As long as you lo-lo-lo.. (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love me (that's all I want baby)
As long as you love, love, love, love me (please don't go)
As long as you love me

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?

This ain't no fucking sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

20, keep the bar rolling
Fake IDs and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign

Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland 
Why? 'Cause

[Hook]
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made history

Tell them imma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Hook]
They loving the crew

[Outro]
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
So broadcast that, nigga we the news in the city
[Rihanna]
Ecstasy... in the air
I don't care, can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired, the worst for wear
'Cause...

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

Can't you say...
Ain't it clear, I don't care
Get closer to me...
If you dare
I double dare
'Cause...

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

[Eminem]
I'm blasted! (Drywall!) Look me in my eyeball!
Do I look high? (No!)
I love the way you lie girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come here dear, I'm trying to get closer to you

I'm motioning you to pull over you boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police, and I'm looking at your REAR, REAR, REAR!
But odds are, Imma end up in the back of a squad car

By the end of tonight
I'm a rock star, get your wind up
It's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are?

Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt, every thought scarred
Got my pants off at the sidewalk, and crosswalks and suspenders
And I can't feel my lips (be)cause...

[Rihanna]
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Would you let it go?

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you
Little princess, summer flowers in her hair
Playing Ring Around The Rosie in the picture there
Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Colouring her lips red in her bedroom, yeah yeah

Prom queen, wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king, barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast

Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread
Climbing ladders, trying to get to the next step
Working hard, always wanting something more
Missing how things were simple like it was before

'Cause it's hard to know just what to do
When I still feel like a child in my mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast

Sometimes I wish I could just go back, and say
"Take your time and just let it last, little girl"

Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Little girl, don't grow up too fast, yeah yeah
[Sample from Notorious B.I.G. - Warning]
It's the one's that smoke blunts wit cha
See your picture, now they wanna grab they guns &amp; come &amp; get cha
*repeat*

Yeah
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already
I'm feeling **** in this bitch

[Verse 1] 
I'm so high even when I'm comin down 
Just met a girl said she from the H-Town, 
I said my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer 
Cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah 
Got these boppers goin crazy 
Nigga I'm the man 
I sent your girl message 
Said I see you when I can 
She send me one back 
But I ain't never read it
Cuz pussy's only pussy 
And I get it when i need it 
and I'm telling you I'm...

(I'm tellin you) I'm coldest, windows down in the winter 
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner 
Airports stunting flyin' charters over seas 
Full of Don Perignon and the water for the D's 
Don't know why it happens everytime we alone 
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone 
So ima sip this drink till' that motherfucker gone 
Then you go get undressed and we gon get it on 

[Verse 2] 
I don't give you the time you deserve from me 
This is something I know, I know, I know 
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston 
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow 
But I do it to her 

Draped up, dripped out know what I'm talkin bout 
3 in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot 
It's on once again and I never pretend 
A nigga stay G till' the end 

[Outro: Talking]
Ayy, Yeah
I swear like, everytime
I find myself in a situation
I just get that feelin like
I'm in Houston
Candy paint switchin colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m
And we just rollin through the city
Bumpin that screw
B.M.O
U.G.K
Lil keke
And I feel like
Everything just movin slow
I just take my time
I pace it baby
Yeah I'm gone ...
Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space, and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
