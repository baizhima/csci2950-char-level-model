i don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but i feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. we weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
you can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. you're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. if you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.
that's what it's....that's what's happening with me. it's like god i'm giving it all i got, sometimes i'm weak and i'm gonna do it, and it's like i'm not giving myself grace, i'm just like understanding, that's just how it is.now i'm like, "wow"
