you got used to being alone, alone
you adapted, now you're used to being alone, all alone
oooh you got used to being on your own

i saw it happenin'
but i didn't accept the truth, i couldn't fathom it
there was so much going on you couldn't handle it
could've divided my time
i should've fractioned it
but

palms is wet, a don's regret
never to walk miles for love, i sit in the starter's deck
it just happened i was floating, you seen the captain?
blinked at me then i threw him my thinking cap
take her, then we could slide to jamaica
shop for like a year or two, stop in diego
it's obvious, i want to see who your mami is
we just friends so she can't clyde, bonnie this
fly walls, dining in fly halls
come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
all my money tied in knots
stand over there, that's why i make it happen on blocks
brazil cut sweater, patent leather
playing the field, trying to outslick baretta

justin bieber
you see my baby over here
hit the road
where she's going that's what nobody knows
i need to find her before another man does
i wouldn't want him to steal my love

i'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
what you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
i'm just trying to find, find, find
the sweet love of mine
i'm running out of time

searching low and high

i'd give it all up for her
but it'll never be enough
i won't stop until i find
my runaway love

kanye west
last name west and my teeth diamonds
she said "yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
listen to wu-tang, trying suits on
accoutrements is grey poupon
stunting in a high top louis', shorts is the coogis
open up the door when you take her to the movies
when you meet the parents, you tell de niro
her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
next show they gotta up the zeros
nobody rocking like this 16 years old
the hard drums and the wally's something that caught me
i'm telling you what wu-tang taught me
the young youth, rocking the gold tooth
pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to cash rules
no question we the reason why the summer's blazing
then say, "you looking good fly coloured asian"
raw i give it to you, no trivia
she used to roll with my g-unit like olivia
until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
i guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine

justin bieber
i'm running out of time
where is my runaway love?
searching low and high
know that i'm not giving up
i'd give it all up for her
but it'll never be enough
i won't stop until i find
my runaway love

why can't i find (why can't i find) you love of mine?
when you're standing in front of my face?
oh i (oh i) i must be blind
how did i let you get away? (yeah)

raekwon

take that queen or shorty up
we can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
waking up resting in cold sweats
thinking of this b*tch, the videotapes, even the stress
my mind is a terrible thing to waste
no love lost, i know i'm going crazy, i can't floss
me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
just like rocking the old pony's
so when i'm chilling, i'm just lost no more feeling
i need my honey in my life get that feel me
take your time, readjust and ya you shine
my runaway love didn't mind, come on

justin bieber

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place

tyga
ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
every beat like a image in the background
i'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
i wanna tell you but there's too many people round
you know i love you, i care but it's unfair
i ain't perfect but i'm tryna be the best i can
if it's real than its gon' come back again
so i'm letting go, i hope you understand
all your friends say, he don't love you
and the grown ups say it's puppy
love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
that i thought
loving you, it was us against the world
you my favorite girl, for you i would go to war
i, take this all in just to show you
or maybe i'm just stuck in the moment

justin bieber
now romeo &amp; juliet
bet they never felt the way we felt
bonnie &amp; clyde
never had to hide like
we do

you and i, both know it can't work
it's all fun and games
'til someone gets hurt
and i don't
i won't let that be you

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're trippin' in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam &amp; eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny &amp; cher
i don't care
i got you baby

see we both
fightin' every inch of our fibers
'cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
we are both too foolish to stop

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
and we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
and i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
baby we both have the right to disagree
and i ain't with it
and i don't wanna be so old and gray
reminiscing 'bout these better days
but convince just telling us to let go
so we'll never know

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
'cause everything we did
and everything we have is stuck in the moment

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
(oh no no)
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
(nothing my heart can do)
to fight with time and space
(and space)
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

look at all of these tears i've wept
look at all the promises that i've kept

i put my heart into your hands
here's my soul to keep
i let you in with all that i can
you're not hard to reach
and you bless me with the best gift
that i've ever known

oh, you are my everything

i don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but i feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. we weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
you can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. you're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. if you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.
that's what it's....that's what's happening with me. it's like god i'm giving it all i got, sometimes i'm weak and i'm gonna do it, and it's like i'm not giving myself grace, i'm just like understanding, that's just how it is.yeah

avalanche comin' down slow
do we have enough time to salvage this love?
feels like a blizzard in april
'cause my heart is just that cold
skating on thin ice
but it's strong enough to hold us up
seen her scream and holler
put us both on blast
tearing each other down

god sent us an angel to help us out
he gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
for that long journey ahead

oh, even in the midst of doubt

life is worth living
life is worth living, so live another day
the meaning of forgiveness
people make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
life is worth living again

what i'd give for my affection
is a different perception
from what the world may see
they try to crucify me
i ain't perfect, won't deny
my reputation's on the line
so i'm working on a better me

life is worth living
life is worth living, so live another day
the meaning of forgiveness
people make mistakes
only god can judge me

you ain't gotta make your mind up.
you ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
right now, don't rush, no pressure.
you ain't gotta make your mind up.
you ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
calm down, don't rush, no pressure.

thought that you were in it for the paper.
never thought i'd take you serious.
now i need you, not a moment later.
losin' it, i'm so delirious.
and i'ma put up a fight for it.
never give up a love like this.
finally i found someone.
that can do me like no other.
talking to my conscience.
i made a few mistakes.
i did it to myself.
i'm the only one to blame.
i know you need a little while to believe again.
to love again.

you ain't gotta make your mind up.
you ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
right now, don't rush, no pressure.
you ain't gotta make your mind up.

i know that you got no plans to leave.
girl i need your attention.
and every time i see you make that face.
i wanna love you all over the place.
don't do it, baby.
don't do it to me, no.

i know you don't wanna talk, right.
we've been on and off like the crosslights.
you heard i'm playin' with them hoes like i golf, right?
when i touch you, i get frostbite.
girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold.
how we so young but livin' so old?
in the bed together but we sleepin' solo.
that could drive you loco.
you supposed to me my uno, yoko ono.
oh no, round two again.
we've been fighting more than ryu and ken
last time we argued eight straight days.
i learned my lesson, i got straight as.
and i know it's deeper than masseuses.
oh, you know i eat the cookie like i'm lucious
go ahead and take the time.
but it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine.
think about it.

you ain't gotta make your mind up.
you ain't gotta make your mind up right now.
right now, don't rush, no pressure.
you ain't gotta make your mind up.
you ain't gotta make your mind up right now.

they tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it.

they ever had trust like how we got it.
they ain't never had a chance how you got it.
so they can't help but to come and hate on it.
they see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it.

you ain't gotta question it.
you already know the answer.
the truth don't make us relevant.
hurts but it's necessary.
don't want us to lose what we are.
lose what we are.

it's like you're always looking for a problem.
the raining of equations for you to solve 'em.
so quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'.
get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em.

they ever had trust like how we got it.
they ain't never had a chance how you got it.
so they can't help but to come and hate on it.

lose what we are.

she texts me "how's you love life?" and "how are you?", i said "i'm good".
they only get as close as you allow them to.
we should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather.
instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever.
i says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer.
hstry sweater, serendipity when you with me.
swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place.
blew your mind, you got my mind going when i'm home.
i'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42.
i've accomplished my goals, it's only you.
you and i in that wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape.
just my mets cap and my badge and i'm straight.
esco.

you ain't gotta question it.

there'll be peace on earth

someday all our dreams will come to be
someday in a world, where men are free
maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at christmas time

someday at christmas we'll see a man
no hungry children and no empty hand
one happy morning people will share
our world where people care

someday at christmas there'll be no tears
all men are equal and no men have fears
one shiney moment my heart ran away
from our world today

someday all our dreams will come to be
someday in a world where men are free
maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at christmas time

someday at christmas man will not fail
take hope because your love will prevail
someday a new world that we can start
with hope in every heart

someday all are dreams will come to be
someday in a world where men are free

about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken, and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
did you know that i loved you or were you not aware?
you're the smile on my face
and i ain't going nowhere
i'm here to make you happy, i'm here to see you smile
i've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

well i can tell you're afraid of what this might do
cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
well i don't wanna lose it either
i don't think i can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
so take my hand
well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
cause i know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall
but if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your...
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

so fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall

if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fallwith you, with you
i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place

now romeo and juliet
bet they never felt the way we felt
bonnie and clyde
never had to hide like we do, we do
you and i both know it can't work
it's all fun and games
'til someone gets hurt
and i don't, i won't let that be you

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two, who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space
'cause i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam and eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny and cher
i don't care, i've got you baby
see we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
we are both too foolish to stop

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two, who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
and i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space
'cause i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like just because this cold, cruel world
saying we can't be
baby, we both have the right to disagree
and i ain't with it
and i don't wanna be so old and gray
reminiscing about these better days
but convention's telling us to let go
so we'll never know

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
'cause everything we did
and everything we have is stuck in the moment
yeah

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
oh no no
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
to fight with time and space (and space)
i'm still stuck in the moment with yousubjected to my system, reflecting on the days
when we used to be just friends
protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank
that's where our hearts once save
and then we got closer
separated from my ex 'til we got closure
ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay

so get used to me checking in all day
get used to me falling through just to see your face
there in the moment i won't need your brace
get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
oh get used to it, hey
oh get used to it, oh it
oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it

and now my april shower you, forever and for me
'til your flowers bloom in june
make sure that our fireworks be a fourth of july for life
as long as you stand right by my side
keep growing closer throughout october

and it's crazy to me, i even see you in my dreams

we were best of friends since we were this high
so why do i get nervous every time you walk by
we would be on the phone all day
now i can't find the words to say to you
now what i'm supposed to do

could there be a possibility
i'm trying to say what's up
cause i'm made for you, and you for me
baby now is time for us
shall i give it all together
but enough is enough
they say we're too young for love
but i'm catching feelings, catching feelings

in my head we're already together
i'm cool alone, but with you i'm better
i just wanna see you smile
you say the word and i'll be right there
i ain't never going nowhere

i'm just trying to see where this can take us
cause everything about you girl is so contagious
i think i finally got it done
now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror
and say it to her

could there be a possibility
i'm trying to say what's up
cause i'm made for you, and you for me
baby now is time for us
shall i give it all together
but enough is enough
they say we're too young for love
but i'm catching feelings, catching feelings

should i tell her, how i really feel
or should i moving closer just be still
how would i know?
cause if i take a chance, and i touch her hand
will everything change?
how do i know, if she feels the same?

could there be a possibility
i'm trying to say what's up
cause i'm made for you, and you for me
baby now is time for us
shall i give it all together
but enough is enough
they say we're too young for love
but i'm catching feelings, catching feelings

catching feelings, catching feelingsi close my eyes, i take it slow.
lay on down and let me rest my soul.
i've been so high, i've been so low.
i'm just tryna find my way back home.
can't help but roam.
my signal's gone.
guess this journey's left me on my own.
i don't care why i'm alone, alone, alone.

and if i could.
forget about the way you love me.
forget about the world, we're set in stone.
i'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.
if only i could hit the ground
i never thought that i'd be broken
i never thought i'd be this far from home.
i'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.
if only i could hit the ground.

i close my eyes, i take it slow.
lay on down and let me rest my soul.
i've been so high, i've been so low.
i'm just tryna find my way back home.
can't help but roam.
my signal's gone.

i'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.
if only i could hit the ground.

take it one day at a time.
reach for the stars now.
ooh just leave the past behind.
it's a part of living.

if only i could hit the ground.
if only i could.
i could hit the ground, right now.
if i could hit the ground.
then i'd be falling down.
if only i could hit the ground.
if i could hit the ground.
then i'd be touching down.
if only i could hit the ground.mafia

and all the clubs you get in using my name
you think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
you think i'm crying on my own, well i ain't

and i didn't wanna write a song 'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't but, you still hit my phone up
and baby i be movin' on and i think you should be somethin'
i don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

but when you told me that you hated my friends
the only problem was with you and not them
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
and tried to make me forget where i came from

and i didn't wanna write a song 'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't but, you still hit my phone up
and baby i be movin' on and i think you should be somethin'

my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love, now i feel nothin' at all
had never felt so low when i was vulnerable
was i a fool to let you break down my walls?

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself

'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourselfyou are to me
a part of me just like anatomy
you're pulling me
you're pulling me in like you're gravity

i'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
instead of hollow
sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

am i in love with you? am i in love with you?
or am i in love with the feeling?
trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
sometimes the heart is deceiving
can't get out of my head, i need you to save me
if i am delusional then maybe i'm crazy
in love with you, am i in love with you?
or am i in love with the feeling?

you give to me
everything, anything that i could dream
and at least that's what it seems
could it be i don't know what's good for me?
