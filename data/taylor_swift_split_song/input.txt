Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Because nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
That before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I let you walk
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
Baby, what about the ending
I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go
On and on, on and on and I will

Skies grow darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just
Gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
And wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggle through the night for someone new
And, yeah, I could go
On and on, on and on

Lantern burning
Flickered in the mind, only you
But you're still
Gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip
Oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love

You'll kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
You'll smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling?"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long, long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

And I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't

Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like
A wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turn black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
And the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away
All my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think that I am finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end.
She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
'Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
You should have been there
Should have burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here." smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking

People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall

And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When ears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should have been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you."
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew.
You call me later
And say "I'm sorry I didn't make it."
And I say "I'm sorry, too."
And that was the moment I knew
It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red,loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head,in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
(I, I, I, I) I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as they pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vulture circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They take their shots, we're bulletproof
(I know places)
And you know for me it's always you
And you're dead at night, your eyes so grey
And I know for you it's always me

(I, I, I, I) I
DJ:
Hey, a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?

Tim McGraw: 
I have heard this song.

DJ:
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?

Tim:
It was awesome. Uh, except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.

DJ:
*laughs*

Tim:
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more... I don't know if it's true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.

DJ:
Why don't we find out? Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?

Taylor:
Oh it's definitely a compliment. Yeah.

*laughs*
DJ:
Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.

Tim:
Nice-

Taylor:
Nice to meet you.

Tim:
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?

Taylor:
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

Tim:
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record! It's doing great.

Taylor:
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker. 

*laughs*
DJ:
Well-

Taylor: 
The funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.

*laughs*
Tim:
Well I'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya.

DJ:
So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked?

Tim:
No.

DJ:
You haven't met?

Tim:
No.

Taylor:
No, we've never talked or met or anything.

Tim:
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.

Taylor:
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.

Tim:
They didn't? Okay well, there ya go. I did.

*laughs*
DJ:
So I-I

Taylor:
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.

Tim:
Not at all.

DJ:
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called "Tim McGraw" without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?

Taylor:
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.

Tim:
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-

Taylor:
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?

Tim:
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.

Taylor:
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.

Tim:
I agree.

DJ:
This, this... tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?

Taylor:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...

*laughs*
Taylor:
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.

Tim:
Now I feel old.

Taylor:
And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.

Tim:
Aww, thank you.

Taylor:
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well that's your first single"

*laughs*
Taylor:
"And I'm like "well..."

Tim:
Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.

*laughs*
Taylor:
That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.

Tim:
Alright, great.

*laughs*
Tim:
Well congratulations 'cause it's your first single, first top ten hit and that's pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.

Taylor:
Awesome, it's been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?

Tim:
Um I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.

*laughs*
Taylor:
Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.

Tim:
Ya do? What would-

Taylor:
Yeah.

Tim:
What would their name be?

Taylor:
Uh, um I think Taylor something.

Tim:
Something like that yeah.

Taylor:
But-

Tim:
Well I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.

Taylor: 
Just consider it.

DJ:
Ah, well that's very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.

Tim:
Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.

DJ:
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.

Tim:
Absolutely.

DJ:
Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.

Taylor:
It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you Tim.

Tim:
You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.

Taylor:
Bye 

Tim:
Good luck out there. 

Taylor:
Thanks
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, have we met?
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing on the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaning to say
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me running but I
kind of know that I won't get far.

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
that you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make you feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said "Okay, let's talk."

And I said "Stay, stay, stay.
I've been loving you,
For quite some time, time, time."
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
I love you because you have given me no choice

But to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time

All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you
For quite some time
No one else is gonna love me

When I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny

When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

That's so fun!
It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And It's coming over you  like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there, watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time 
I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know

I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Though I never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes
I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I cry
Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause I - I
I want to be everything you need
I want to be where...

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be you're everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes...beautiful eyes
This is wrong but
I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open that night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh, didn't they tell us, "Don't rush into things?"
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind

Oh, darling, we found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland

I reach for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home

You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever (last forever)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better (never better)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better

In Wonderland
It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me
You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything 
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, ohh

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it, baby
You said forever and always, yeah
<div class="lyricbox">New to town with a made-up name,
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they’ll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they tell you now
But can you tell me now
You’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

And they’ll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now

Can you tell me now
You’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh

Yeah, they'll tell you now
You’re the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh</div>
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie 
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe

Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe

Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you bound me, you bound me

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realise the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (You were right there)
So shame on me now (You were right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been(Oh)
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you'd seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
And everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful, running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on the tightrope
It's never too late to get back
<div class="lyricbox">I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I’m not fine at all...

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin’ over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up

Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel
In the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly
It's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again
Where I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well</div>
<div class="lyricbox">She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we’re invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes
And make you realise

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile</div>
Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at Sorry!
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed
By me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad, empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And It's coming over you  like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there, watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time 
I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know

I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Though I never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it
It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home


This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all so I thought that
I'd never see nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving? 
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me 
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
Shine, shine, shine

Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself
I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did.

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

(Think about what you did.)
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah...
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better!
She took him faster than you can say sabotage...
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted, was to be wanted
Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen

La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home


This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
<div class="lyricbox">I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don’t you?

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Oh, run away
La la, oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you’ll say "Let’s run away now
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn’t say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"</div>
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realised by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips are sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you when she blows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's ferocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did.

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

(Think about what you did.)
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah...
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better!
She took him faster than you can say sabotage...
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her, but I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah, and you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure, you understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
<div class="lyricbox">I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window, lookin' out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

Whoa, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you’re touching my face
And askin' me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me</div>
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
I'm reachin out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
And when you're close I feel like coming undone.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're sayin that you'd be here anyway.
But you're untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night we could form this dream.
I wanna feel you by my side, standin next to me.
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

Oh, Oh. 
I'm caught up in you. 
Oh, Oh, Oh.

Untouchable burnin brighter than the sun,
And when you're close I feel like comin undone.
You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin out your name
You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.
He said, "Let's get out of this town"
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever

But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is...

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams...

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever

But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is...

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams...

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I'll bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down (down)
Someday when you leave me
I'll bet these memories
Follow you around (follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend...

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
(Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams...
In your wildest dreams...

(Even if just real in your)
Wildest dreams...
In your wildest dreams...
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.)
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey!
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
(I don't know about you)
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
(You don't know about me)
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
(Dance like we're)
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (oh-woah-oh)
Twenty-two (dancing like)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time

Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better.

[Both]
Right before your eyes,
I’m breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me.

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Both]
Right before your eyes,
I’m aching
Run fast, nowhere to hide,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I’m asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list.
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong,

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I say "It’s been you all along."

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time I let you in my door

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Both]
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time I’m asking you this

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I’m asking you this

[Taylor Swift]
Put my name at the top of your list

[Gary Lightbody]
Put my name at the top of your list

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time I’m asking you why

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I’m asking you why

[Taylor Swift]
You broke my heart in the blink of an eye

[Gary Lightbody]
You break my heart

[Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this</div>
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything 
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, ohh

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it, baby
You said forever and always, yeah
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Halleluia!

Christ the savior is born

It's 2:00 AM, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Bet it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish, I wish, I

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

I wish you would
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, have we met?
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing on the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaning to say
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Ed Sheeran
We good to go?

Taylor Swift
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now
I didn't before

And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

Taylor Swift &amp; Ed Sheeran
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Ed Sheeran
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you.

Taylor Swift
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like

Taylor Swift &amp; Ed Sheeran
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

Taylor Swift
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

Taylor Swift &amp; Ed Sheeran
All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
I know it is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed.

Taylor Swift
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know it is pouring rain

Taylor Swift &amp; Ed Sheeran
And everything has changed

Taylor Swift
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days I'll know your face
I know it since yesterday

Taylor Swift &amp; Ed Sheeran
Is everything has changed
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile

Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh
Looking at it now
It all seemed so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world is black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
On the night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided
We decided to move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
And you started crying, baby I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
But when the sun came up, you were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
I remember
Oh I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
It's 2:00 AM, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Bet it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish, I wish, I

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

I wish you would
You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat

I say I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl

He says what you heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I
I said I've been there too a few times

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home

(Out of style)
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style
Please take down the mistleoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyon's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everynbody
That'll have to be something I just say this year

Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases whe I didn't 
Wonder how you are tonight
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say "Are you insane?"

Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would weep for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
It's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it
Used to be, be, yeah, yeah
With pictures in frames
Of kisses on cheeks, cheeks

Tell her how you must've lost your mind, ooh
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl

And now you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would weep for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah yeah

And you could know
That I don't want you to go

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would weep for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl
(Get the girl)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl

That's how it works
That's how you got the girl
When the sun shines 
We'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be your friend 
Took an oath 
I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we still have each other 
You can stand under my Umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella 
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Eh eh

You had my heart
And we'll never be world apart 
Maybe in magazines 
But you'll still be my star 
Baby cause in the Dark
You can see shiny Cars 
And that's when you need me there 
With you I'll always share 
Because 

When the sun shines 
We'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be your friend 
Took an oath 
I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we still have each other 
You can stand under my Umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella 
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Eh eh

These fancy things, 
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity 
Here for Infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt it's cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because ...

When the sun shines 
We'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be your friend 
Took an oath 
I'mma stick it out 'till the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we still have each other 
You can stand under my Umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella 
(ella ella eh eh eh)
I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight

I'm a Barbie on the boardwalk
Summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen
And crazy, running wild, wild

Can't remember what song
It was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said "Look at you, worrying too much about,
Things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that away."

He was trying to skip rocks
On the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say "Never say never..."
 
...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
<div class="lyricbox">I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don’t you?

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Oh, run away
La la, oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you’ll say "Let’s run away now
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn’t say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"</div>
In the heat of the fight
I walked away.
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay.
I said "This time I had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up.
'cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more!
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

Me and my stupid pride
Sittin' here alone.
Going through the photographs,
Staring at the phone.
I keep going back over
The things we both said.
And I remember the slammin' door,
And all the things that I misread.
Baby you know everything,
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to
Chase after me? Yeah,

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more!
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

And I scream out the window
"I can't even look at you, I don't need you!",
But I do, I do, I do...
"See, there's nothing you can say
To make right again, I mean it, I mean it!",
What I mean is:

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

With your face,
And your beautiful eyes,
And the conversation,
With the little white lies.
And the faded picture
Of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car
Up the stairs
And I broke-down cryin'
Was it worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess,
I need you
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there

Now that he's back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had in May

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had in May
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

"Merry Christmas" - I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl under cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special

Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Try and catch me now oh-oh
It's too late, to catch me now
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light

To you everything's funny
You've got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No, no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen there is just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
Getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up
Never grow up
Just never grow up

[Taylor Swift]
Hello??
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red,loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head,in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

"Oh my God, look at that face!"
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
And I know all the steps, 
Up to your door
But, I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind
Talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up,
And sing you a song
But, I don't want to have to go that far
And I, I got you down
I know you by heart,
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself
Talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here,
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long,
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But, I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back

Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough

Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
Blue light reflects
The chain on your neck

He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word

And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face

Pauses, then says
"You're my best friend."
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing
In a snow globe round your neck
And he keeps the picture
Of you in his office downtown

And you understand now why they
Lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life
Tryin' to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmh-hmm

I go on too many dates (heh-heh)
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, mmh-hmm
That's what people say, mmh-hmm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

I never miss a beat, ah
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmh-hmm
That's what they don't see, mmh-hmm

I'm dancin' on my own (dancin' on my own)
I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmh-hmm
That's what they don't know, mmh-hmm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God"
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there
With the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (they fake, they fake, they fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)

I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...
<div class="lyricbox">I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made
And that was the first day

And, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you."
And for the first time I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story’s got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you</div>
I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know,
I didn't read,
Between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, 
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late
So you see,
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah
How can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face
Oh, I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted
I had time to think it over and all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all 
So jump then fall

Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here, baby
I'll show you, I'll show you you can

Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah
Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me,
Back in your heart

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back

I want you back, ohh baby
I want you back

Ohh woah-oh
Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me,
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at Sorry!
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed
By me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad, empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known
You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now
Tall, dark, and Superman
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yeah

And you'll smile and say, how are you?
I'll say just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you
I'll love you forever

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark, and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday he'll take me away
And save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they said

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love struck, and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the car was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around, forever and ever
And I watched Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
'Cause baby now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me?
where I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last

Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts

Mmm, if you love like that blood runs cold
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling?"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long, long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

And I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered
You said it in a simple way
Four a.m., the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then you catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, "Don't get attached."
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here

The delicate, beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can't put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

In New York, be here
But you're in London
And I break down
This is not fair
That you're not around

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here

I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

"Oh my God, look at that face!"
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
'Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said "Welcome to New York"
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

It's been waiting for you

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
Beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you

When we first dropped out bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want: boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you

It's been waiting for you

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
Beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

Like any great love
It keeps you guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love
It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change
Anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you

It's been waiting for you

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me

(Welcome to New York)
New soundtrack, it's been waiting for you
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
So bright they never blind me

Welcome to New York
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
<div class="lyricbox">Took a deep breath in the mirror 
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do 
Turned the lock and put my headphones on 
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do 

Walked in expecting you'd be late 
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you 
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don't know how nice that is 
But I do 

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I’m funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again 

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you 
But I do 
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy 
But I do 

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again 

And we walk down the block to my car 
And I almost brought him up 
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that 
For the first time, what's past is past 

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again</div>
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Drew looks at me

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed

The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay) 


Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made

People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay) 


Let me remind you this was what you wanted
You're in the air
You were all I wanted
But not like this

Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was (stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was (stay)

All you had to do was (stay) 
All you had to do was (stay)
<div class="lyricbox">And it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I’ll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

So we’ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We’re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we’re faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don’t need this
But there’s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Do you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It’s a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah</div>
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me running but I
kind of know that I won't get far.

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
that you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make you feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
I'm five years old 
Its getting cold out, got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you 
I run and run, past the pumpkin patch, and the tractor rides 
Look now, the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know youre not scared of anything at all 
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I'm thirteen now 
And dont know how my friends could be so mean 
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop til I forgot all their names 

I dont know who I'm gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you 
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out hes better than I am 
I grew up in a pretty house 
And I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 

There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me 
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
And daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
Staying back and watching me shine 
And I didnt know if you knew so I'm taking this chance to say 
That I had the best day with you today
We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true (ah)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on 
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

And I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why, why, tell me why

I take a step back, and let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah

We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment, now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby, but I've figured you out
And you thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could have loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting  in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
(I, I, I, I) I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as they pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vulture circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They take their shots, we're bulletproof
(I know places)
And you know for me it's always you
And you're dead at night, your eyes so grey
And I know for you it's always me

(I, I, I, I) I
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end.
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie
Tell me what you would find

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to 
All the things that we wish they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I'd think there was somethingwe all forgot
What would happenif presents all went away
Tell me what would you find

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something 
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There's gotta be more
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me
