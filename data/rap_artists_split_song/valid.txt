pushing big whips, chains <unk> love
but y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
we know how you <unk>
thinking we gon' hit your friend if you <unk> to date
claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
but y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[drake:]
uh, <unk> be saying that i'm <unk> i'm hella nice
for that i've been approached to sign to roc-a-fella twice
haters tell you all the rumors they heard
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like i'm <unk> <unk>
my groove <unk> is that when you too <unk>
they try to bring you down to the level they at
well when they are all <unk> then it gets a little sticky
that's why i am little <unk> to these devils in rap
but, uh, they ain't thinking drake get smart girl
nah, they probably think i'll break your heart girl
haha, i can't lie, you probably right about it
and if you give me the ass quick, i'll probably write about it
but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound
i mean i spit that <unk> shit from my town
i don't know why you sitting on the couch
when you see i got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
you think taking your purse off
will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i could've been a local emcee
and you probably would've been worse off
so i'm a take this hat off, and i'm a hit it till i backs off
and then i'm back <unk>

i think you've been watching too much <unk> <unk>
you need to get real and check out my real life
i ain't a <unk> don't care what it smell like

[chorus]
<unk>
they say you never judge a book by it's cover
though you appear as <unk> just like the others
so i followed your words to take 'em in
and i don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
that's when i felt that i would need to
do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you
and try to get inside your head only
not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
so what i learned on my path to <unk>
your story took one ugly turn after another
i saw we wasn't on the same page
i would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
so now i'm <unk> the case
you only out for the <unk> that's written all over your face
no <unk> will never judge a book by it's cover
until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

come up in the club with that fresh shit on
something crazy on my <unk>
and heres another hit barry bondsnow beat that.
and your mother's sayin' go to college
so you finish college and it's wonderful
you feel so good.
now after all the partying and <unk>
and don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school bein' around your <unk>
hey! now you'll get that 25 <unk> job a year
and you'll spend all your money on <unk>
but it'll be your money.
no more <unk> from mom for my high
so now you get your degree tattooed on your back you're so excited about it

if you continue to work at the <unk>
after several interviews
oh my god, you'll come in at an <unk> level position
and when you do that, if you kiss enough ass
you'll move up to the next level,
which is bein' a <unk> <unk>
and boy is that <unk>
you get to take messages for the <unk> who never went to college
she's actually the <unk> <unk>
so now you're part of the family

you know what college does for you?
it makes you really smart man.
all you kids wanted talk in the back of the <unk>
not me, i <unk> ok
i was a <unk>
it was meant to <unk>
you know how many classes i <unk>
extra <unk> extra classes
no i've never had <unk>
but ya know what?
my degree keeps me <unk>

when a lady walked wit' me she say
ya know what's <unk>
no i don't know what it is
but i bet i could add up all the change in your <unk>
very fastthings have been so crazy and <unk>
i should have gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
it's probably better <unk>

so if you gotta go
if there's anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if you're looking for a purpose

you put the tea in the <unk> and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was <unk>

now i'm all singing <unk>
further than i've ever been
so if you gotta go
if there's any way i can help

isn't it ironic that the girl i wanna marry is a wedding <unk>
that tells 'em my life is too much and moves to atlanta
damn, of all the places you could go
i just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

i always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
i hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady

i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the <unk>
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
don't be <unk> by the money i'm still young and just <unk>
i'm surprised you couldn't tell

i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and you're looking for a purpose

i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and you're looking for a purposethe more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
we say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
it's lust, 'cause neither one of us <unk> each other so we fuck
till we bust, till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
shout till i throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
we fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize <unk> laughter
pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
there ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do

'cause the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

'cause i hate you, do you hate me?
good, 'cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you

you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut, but i'm equal, i'm a <unk> we're both <unk> our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

we can make <unk> people spread <unk>
but they ain't got proof, till they do, it's just the two of us
you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's <unk> me
but you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be <unk> yeah i would
'cuz the sex is too damn good, if i ran, who would i run to

share this common <unk> you're the only one i can fuck
without a condom on, i hope the only reason that i <unk>
is 'cuz of that fact and i can bust in that, and that's why

we're lying to <unk> that's the beauty of it, yeah

and just when i went to fill him with hot lead
i put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

(eminem)
you never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but i know you - the name's slim - you want <unk>
then don't shoot, i'm in the same boots as you
i'm tellin the truth, i got a price on my head too, cause when you..

chorus: <unk> <unk>
you ride like a <unk> toward the sun
and life ain't fun, when you're on the run
got your gold and you got your gun
but life as an <unk> just begun
got your shotgun by your side
got your horse and you got your pride
you ride til there ain't no place to hide
it's sad cause the bad guys always die

(dr. dre) + (eminem)
he was <unk> i seen by the look on his face
he said take ten <unk> <unk> i took eight
spun around and i aimed straight for the brain
my <unk> went bang but it only fired a <unk> he said
(you need bullets, hurry up <unk> <unk> slick <unk>
i put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
we both drew at the same time and stood <unk>
(go ahead, shoot me, but i'm not the one you <unk>
i figured he was tellin the truth, that's why i didn't shoot
so what we gon' do, it's on you
(do you recall when you and snoop was a <unk>

(and plus i know who's got it)

(some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold <unk>
loaded up my <unk> got ready for battle
hid two pieces of gold inside of my <unk>
we rolled two miles until we hit the spot
an old ghost town that everybody forgot
a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
slim grabbed the shotgun <unk> here's the <unk>

(eminem)
this is the spot, they call him doc <unk>
he's goin around sayin he took the game from us
(let's shoot him in his <unk> he'll never see it <unk>
but he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
he's got <unk> legs, he spins <unk>
plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

(dr. dre)
i drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
kicked the <unk> doors in, started gun <unk>
i could hear somebody <unk> - it sounded like a "g <unk>
and a verse from <unk> their heads <unk>
i said "it's dre's <unk> and started to spray
against <unk> he <unk> a ak
hollow tips started flyin every which way

(eminem)
that's when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i fired the first shot, spun his body around
he hit the ground and landed upside down
dre grabbed the <unk> the plaques and the gold
i grabbed two <unk> and a <unk> that's rolled

and she took my word for it, that's all i had to say
lately i just feel so out of character
the <unk> can start to turn into <unk>
thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a <unk>
i get a blank page when i try to draw a <unk>
i'm getting straight to the point with it

i got a pure soul, i don't do the hate

me and <unk> used to plot on how to make a change
now me and kobe doing shots the night before the game

lamborghini got me feeling like i'm christian <unk>
and i never bend my <unk> for the ticket sales
<unk> <unk> bars heavy like triple <unk>

running through the 6, <unk> through the <unk>

and like it's going in a trunk, i put it all behind us
where you tryna go? i got it, i'll take us wherever
i'm a <unk> in the game, all my papers together

kanye west:
so this a&amp;r over at roc-a-fella, named hip hop picked the <unk> beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me, you know, like i always do
i play the <unk> he's like "who that <unk> i'm like "it's <unk> he's like "oh, well <unk>
uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
just askin' me to send him beats, and i'm thinking he's trying to get into <unk> <unk> 'cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin' with
and um, he was friends with my <unk> no id
and no id told him, "look man, you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he <unk>
(yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he <unk>
i was all, i dunno if he was <unk> me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
(i'll sign you as a producer and a <unk>
i'm like "oh shit"
i was messin' with, uh, <unk> also
people were like this, started talking about the ghost <unk> but that's how i got in the game
if it wasn't for that, i wouldn't be here
so you know, after they picked that truth beat i was <unk> i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that
i was stayin' in chicago, i had my own <unk> i be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and <unk> get a pelle pelle off <unk> get some <unk> or something or get a <unk> that's what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i <unk> up this <unk> <unk> sample
i played it for hip over the phone, he's like, "oh, yo that shit is crazy, jay might want it for this <unk> album he <unk> called the <unk>
and at that time, like the drums really weren't <unk> right to me
so i went and um, i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just, like bit the drums off <unk> and put it like with it <unk> up, <unk>
and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it <unk> when he <unk> on "this can't be life"
and that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the <unk> of the soul sound and you know, i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other <unk>
i really wanted to roll with hip hop 'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what i'm sayin' 'cause i been there for a while i <unk> what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day, i came and i <unk> the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said, "oh you a real <unk> <unk>
(oh you a real <unk> dude, man)
and <unk> uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take
and he said, "tell me what you think of <unk>
(check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here)
and i heard it, and i was thinking like, <unk> i really wanted more like of the simple type <unk>
i ain't want like the, the more <unk> complicated <unk> or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me, "what you think of <unk>
(so what you think of this?)
and i was like, <unk> that shit <unk>
you know what i'm <unk> man what i'mma tell him?
i was on the <unk> man, you know
so after that i went back home and man i'm, i'm just in chicago, i'm trying to do my thing
you know, i got <unk> i got acts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like, poppin' off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my <unk> he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my <unk> company, but he ended up going straight with the company
so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company
and i got <unk> at the same time
so i went down and <unk> the beats from him
i took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a <unk> maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out
so i ain't have to deal with the <unk> 'cause he's a jerk
me and my mother drove to <unk> new jersey
(come on, let's just go)
i <unk> even seen my apartment
i remember i pulled up, i <unk> all my shit
<unk> baby, we're here)
you know, we went to <unk> i bought a bed, i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my <unk> and the first beat i made was, uh, <unk> of the <unk>
and beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came up there to <unk> it was <unk> birthday, matter of fact, and i played like seven beats
and, you know i guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he <unk> i had did <unk> like it" already at that time
but then jay walked in, i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like, like it was yesterday
and hip hop said, "yo play that one beat for <unk>
so i played <unk> of the <unk> and really i made <unk> of the <unk> i really wanted to give that beat to <unk>
(no i think jay gon' like this one right here)
and i played another beat, and i played another beat and i remember that gucci <unk> he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, <unk>
two days later, i'm in <unk> and i seen dame
dame didn't know who i was and i was like, <unk> what's up i'm <unk>
(yo, you that kid, <unk>
"you that kid that gave all them beats to <unk> yo, this nigga got <unk> to beats <unk>
(yo, jay got <unk> <unk>
you know i ain't talkin shit
i'm like, "oh shit"
and all this time, i'm <unk> man, i'm still thinking <unk> you know i'm <unk> these niggas on the show the streets is <unk> i'm <unk> these were <unk> in my eyes and they still are, you know
so, jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days
i gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story
the day i did the <unk> be <unk> beat on track, i remember <unk> <unk> he had some louis vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly
and hip hop was there, i think <unk> john <unk> a bunch of people
i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and i said, "yo jay i could <unk>
and i spit this rap that said, uh, "i'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
<unk> <unk> benz, i push miracle <unk>
and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
but you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the <unk> he said, <unk> that was <unk>
<unk> that was cool, that was <unk>
that was it, you know, i ain't get no deal then, haha
okay, fast forward
so, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> my first hit single
and i just took that <unk> built relationships with people, my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man, yo, i <unk> i love him for that
and at this time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had <unk> and i had relationships with all these <unk> and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, i'd play them some beats
"gimme a beat that sound like <unk> you know, they dick <unk> whatever
so i'll play them these <unk> beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit. i'll
be like, "yo but i rap <unk> hey, i guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here, i played them <unk> <unk> and they didn't sign me
you know what <unk> it was some <unk> that fucked with me though, but then like the <unk> it'd be somebody at the company that'll say <unk>
like, dave <unk> fucked with me, my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of <unk> jessica <unk> man
<unk> you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign kanye, for <unk>
i'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my <unk> up
<unk> niggas is <unk>
let's just say i didn't get my deal
the nigga that was behind me, i mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know?
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe <unk> from <unk> records
he wanted to sign me really bad
(we gonna change the game, <unk>
dame was like, "yo you got a deal with <unk> okay man, just make sure it's not <unk>
(you gotta make sure it's not <unk>
then one day i just went ahead and played it, i wanted to play some <unk> 'cause you know cam was in the room, young <unk> and
dame was in the room
so i <unk> actually it's a song that you'll never <unk> but maybe i might use it
so, it's called <unk>
"i go to jacob with twenty-five <unk> you go with 25 <unk> wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
you got your first gold single, damn, nigga, <unk> like the chorus went
don't bite that <unk> i might still use it
so i play that song for him, and he's like, "oh shit"
(oh shit, it's not even <unk>
"i ain't gonna front, it's kinda <unk>
(it's actually kinda <unk>
like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper
and i'm sure dame <unk> <unk> man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album, you know
so uh dame took me into the <unk> and he's like "yo man, b, b, you don't want a brick, you don't want a <unk>
(you don't wanna catch a <unk>
"you gotta be under an <unk> you'll get <unk> <unk>
i told hip hop and hip hop was all, "oh, <unk>
<unk> even with that i was still about to take the deal with <unk> 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with <unk>
that, you know, 'cause i told him i was gonna do it, and i'm a man of my word, i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do
then, you know, i'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer <unk> and told <unk> that told the heads of the <unk> and right
the day i'm talking about, i planned out everything i was gonna do man, i had picked out clothes
i already started <unk> studio <unk> i started <unk> my album, thinking of <unk> <unk> man i was ready to go
and they had mel call me, they said, "yo
<unk> pulled on the <unk>
(yo, <unk> pulled out on the <unk>
and, you know i told them that roc-a-fella was <unk>
and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
i went up
i called g, i said, <unk> you think we could still get that deal with <unk>

let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

can't you see what you do to me, baby
you make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
i'm like a <unk> you make me sick
you're truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy

i go <unk> i get so insane i just go <unk>
one minute i wanna slit your throat, the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy, the way we act like two <unk> in the sack
we fuck like two <unk> and maybe that's a bad habit

'cause the next day we right back at it
in the same exact <unk>
what the fuck is the matter with us
we can't figure out if it's lust
or if it's love which that is <unk> us to each other
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother

which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today

but you <unk> it, you hit me first
and <unk> me to choke you
just 'cause i came home late last night
<unk> in bed and i woke you

but if there's one thing about you that i <unk> it's baby
because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as i am
'cause when i look at you, i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside, i see a <unk> little side

like a devil in disguise
you're always full of <unk>
always pullin' <unk> out your, personal <unk>
and <unk> you've fucked yourself so much
you barely feel those <unk> you're only 24
but you're plenty more <unk>
then those other little ho's

who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still you're crazy, <unk> cool
chillin' you play your position you never step out of line
even though i stay in your business
you've always kept out of mine

i wonder what's on your mind
sometimes they say love is blind
maybe that's why the first time i <unk> your eye
you ain't see the sign
or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge
baby, 'cause we're crazy in love

i go crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

you are the ink to my paper
what my pen is to my my pad
the <unk> the very <unk>
the whole <unk> to my rap

you are my reason for being
the meaning of my <unk>
if it wasn't for you
i would never be able to spit this

as intense as i do, and the <unk>
is you <unk> on me as much
as i <unk> on you to inspire me like you do
you provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire
you're my entire supply of gas, the match and <unk>

the only way that i'm able to stay so stable
is you're the legs to my table
if you were to break i'd fall on my face
but i'm always gonna make you feel
i don't need you as much as i really need you
so you don't use it to your advantage

but you're <unk> to me
you're the air i breathe
i believe if you ever leave me
i'd probably have no reason to be

you are the kim to my marshall
you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem
the <unk> to my hailie

you are the word that i'm lookin' for
when i'm tryin' to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just won't come to my mind

you're like the pillow that props me up
the beam that <unk> me
the bitch who never took half
the wife who never divorced me

you're like the root to my evil
you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you
before you beat the shit out me

and no matter how much too much is never enough
baby, 'cause we're crazy in love

i go crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohlook if you ain't worth a <unk> you ain't far from broke
got <unk> heart to sell weed but you scared of dope
i wouldn't snitch on my peoples if the feds grabbed me
yo ass would hit more notes than ron <unk>
i wouldn't rhyme about <unk> if i had no watch
wouldnt write about crack if i ain't had no spot

<unk>the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
we say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
it's lust, 'cause neither one of us <unk> each other so we fuck
till we bust, till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
shout till i throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
we fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize <unk> laughter
pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
there ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do

'cause the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more

i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

'cause i hate you, do you hate me?
good, 'cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you

you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut, but i'm equal, i'm a <unk> we're both <unk> our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

we can make <unk> people spread <unk>
but they ain't got proof, till they do, it's just the two of us
you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's <unk> me
but you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be <unk> yeah i would
'cuz the sex is too damn good, if i ran, who would i run to
that would be this soft and <unk> so it's off and on
usually more off then on but at least we know that we
share this common <unk> you're the only one i can fuck
without a condom on, i hope the only reason that i <unk>
is 'cuz of that fact and i can bust in that, and that's why

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's making me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

i can never understand it, that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why must we try
is it really so rough that we must always call each other's billy <unk> <unk>

try to pull each other's legs until the other <unk>
we're lying to <unk> that's the beauty of it, yeah
'cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night

and it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this <unk> up rage

we gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
<unk> <unk> crazy, ain't he? yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

when it <unk> when it <unk> two little beautiful girls
lookin' <unk> in a <unk> i know it's <unk> you
daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

i try to keep you <unk> from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that, the more it <unk> on me
all the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have gotten so bad between us i don't see us ever being together
ever again like we used to be when we was <unk>
but then of course everything always happens for a reason

i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

now hush little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
<unk> that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night

i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright

it's funny, i remember back one year, when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying

'cause daddy felt like a <unk> see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom

was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
on the <unk> in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on <unk>
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre and flew you and mama out to see me

but daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv
and mama didn't like it and you and <unk> were to young to understand it
papa was a rollin' <unk> momma <unk> a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house
just <unk> lookin' at your baby <unk> it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
<unk> i'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
i like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
<unk> mama's only gone for the moment

now hush little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
<unk> that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night

i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright

and if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a <unk>
i'mma give you the world
i'mma buy a diamond ring for you, i'mma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile

and if that <unk> don't sing and that ring don't shine

oh lord, please don't let me be <unk>

<unk>
i'm watchin' tv the other day right?
they had this white guy on there.
talkin' about black <unk> talkin' about how young black guys, are <unk>
<unk> by who?
<unk>
you see, 1 in every 100 americans are locked up.
1 in every 9 black americans, are locked up.
and see, what the white guy was tryin' to stress was that, the money we spend on sendin' a <unk> to jail, a young <unk> to jail, would be less to send his or her <unk> to <unk>
see and another thing the white guy was tryin' to stress was that our <unk> are <unk> with, drug <unk>
you know, crack <unk> yeah, stuff like that.
<unk> due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine the police are <unk> well i don't wanna say only right but shit only <unk> by ridin' around in the hood all day and not in the <unk>
because, crack cocaine is <unk> found, in the <unk>
and you know the other thing is [laugh] you know where i'm <unk>
but why bring a <unk> to jail if it's not gonna stand up, in <unk>
because this drug ain't that <unk> you know level 3, level 4 drugs, shit like that.
i guess it's all a <unk>
and um, i sit back, "well shit those <unk> that 1 in every 9, were probably only sellin' the crack cocaine is 'cause we in the <unk>
and it's not like your <unk> we don't have the things that you <unk>
why? i really don't wanna know the <unk>
but uh, i guess we just <unk>
you know we don't have room in the jail for the real <unk> the real <unk>
sex <unk> <unk> serial killers shit like that.

what you got? you got a daughter, son? what you <unk> [laugh]
i have a daughter, you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my man into jail, just because, the reason he live next door to me, ain't the reason i live next door to him?
<unk> he didn't rap his way to my, fuckin' <unk>
he sold crack cocaine to get to my <unk>
you move him out, bring him to jail for life and then you move in the sex <unk> [laugh] then give me a paper.
is that a <unk> 'cause i don't understand it.

another <unk>
let me take my glasses off 'cause i wanna see the reaction on the faces when i say <unk> al <unk> why i don't respect you and nobody like you.
see, your the type that gets off on gettin' on other <unk>
that's not good, no <unk>
and rather <unk> i should say, i mean given the fact that <unk> well good <unk> <unk> to me is <unk> one another no matter your color or <unk>
but this guy and people like him they'd rather <unk> before they <unk> if that's the <unk>
you know, <unk> before <unk>
<unk> i'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can <unk> an opinion before you make one just my thought of good <unk> mr. <unk>
hold on, i ain't finished wit you man, just gotta <unk> the <unk>
mr. <unk> and anyone like you, you don't know me so if your not gonna try to then what you do or think or whatever i do is totally <unk> the friendly ghost, to me.
and it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you <unk> doesn't <unk> make you a bad person either but the <unk> fall <unk> into <unk> <unk>
but since i am <unk> i am good and bad as <unk>
but i try my hardest to stay good.
and some of the things i say and do may be bad, or just not too good [laugh]
but i do <unk> so <unk> hat said i don't fault you. your only <unk>i own a <unk> but live in a house
a <unk> bed, but i sleep on the couch
i'm mr. <unk> glass is half full
but my <unk> half empty, <unk> just blew

this always <unk> thirty minutes from home
gotta lay a log <unk> and only option i have is <unk> bathroom
in a public stall dropping a <unk>
so every time someone walks in the john i get <unk>

<unk> to the <unk> <unk> i'm a <unk> ass

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
<unk> been good to me so <unk>

they call me <unk> i heard that, i second and third that
don't know what the fuck i'd doing if it weren't rap
