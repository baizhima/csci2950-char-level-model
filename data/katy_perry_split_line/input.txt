<div class="lyricbox">If you want me,
The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The crème de la crop,
If you want me you better do better than that tonight
Oh, oh

If you want me, it takes more than a wink,
More than a drink,
More than you think,
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight

'Cause some don't have the patience,
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill,
'Cause that's the deal

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass,
A one night stand, a storage shed,
I think you better walk by tonight,
Oh no

If you want me,
Then stop begging,
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight

But I don't need your dollar bills,
I just want something real,
'Cause nothing's free,
Except loving me

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me

If you want me,
The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The crème de la crop

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford...

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me</div>
Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues

I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float


This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

Oh, oh-oh
You make me float
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time every time when you're touching me
I'll make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one bosomed energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science, we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles just to find the magic seed
Oh, what a flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet

Always on the brink of a heart attack
You give me life and keep me coming back
I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies
Even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not
I know when we were in perfect harmony
You make me sound like
Like a symphony

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID 
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

This is the last time you say 
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate

You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank

Thought that I was the exception
I could rewrite your addiction
You coulda been the greatest
But you rather get wasted

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype

You think you're so rock 'n roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fucking choked

Shoulda been my teammate
Coulda changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You're going down, you're going down, you're going down

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Mmm
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

Mmm
I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
(Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold)

Mmm
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
I don't wanna be either
I wanna be, next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
<div class="lyricbox">Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
The one
Baby you're a
California girls

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I’m a get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one

In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked-out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again

T.G.I.F.

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six-feet-under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon</div>
Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh woah

So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah
Except for me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me, no
Away from me
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?

Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down the man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you?

I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you
To say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man

You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be
A real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem,
Our future could solve 'em, baby.
I could bring you to life,
If you let me inside, baby
This'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man

You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,
A toy, could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand
But you're not a man

You're not a man,
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,
But you're not a man

Trying to connect the dots

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest

That was such an epic fail

I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So, if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light?
Is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one, without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one (the one)

In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
<div class="lyricbox">I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
‘Cause I'm sending all the signs

That the clock is ticking, 
And I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We’re going down for sure
Already lost the grip
Best abandon ship, oh-oh

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education 
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
‘Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It’s all for the better 
That we end this here
Let’s close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We’re going down for sure
And we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost

‘Cause I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We’re going down for sure
Already lost the grip
Best abandon ship, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
Oh-oh-oh-oh</div>
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air)

You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah, you take me to utopia
You read me like erotica
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and hotter than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air tonight 
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air tonight

I'm walking on air tonight 
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air tonight 

(To-to-to-tonight, to-to-to)
This is pure paradise
Even heaven is jealous of our love
Yes, we make angels cry
Raining down on Earth from up above

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and hotter than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air tonight 
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air tonight

I'm walking on air tonight 
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air tonight 

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, to-to-tonight, to-to-tonight, I'm walking on air

Heaven is jealous of our love
Angels are crying from up above

Tonight I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air tonight

I'm walking on air tonight 
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air tonight 

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Tonight, to-to-tonight, to-to-tonight, I'm walking on air
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me

Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you're in love, in love with

So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more standing in my own way
Let's go deeper, let's get closer
The way I want you to love me

No more standing in my own way
Let's go deeper, let's get closer
The way I want you to love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down...
You're a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks and opens the gold mine

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you it was all pitter-patter

Secretly, hit the lottery 'cause you're
Brighter than all of the Northern lights
You speak to me even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price

They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

To the bottom of the sea I'd go to find you
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you
Every step I take I'm keeping you in mind

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one, without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one (the one)

In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
Dressin' up
For you

Saucer of milk, table for two
You wanna pet my kitty? You're such a dirty doggie
It's your lucky night, 'cause I'm in the mood
I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty

Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

I could tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night 

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

You're getting hot so let's call the nurse
I feel a fever, let's take your temperature
Better behave or a police officer will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve

Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tied, tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling 

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up
Can you tell me
Who called a race
Can anyone stay in one place
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time

But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me

All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me
Be here with me now

Do you ever think that
We're just chasing our tails
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize

But you know who I
Who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me

All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me
Be here with me now

'Cause the future is right now
Right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now
I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me

All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me
Be here with me now
<div class="lyricbox">Living in fear is not what You had in mind for me
But holding to You is so hard
I cling to what I see

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You’re piercing me
This self will bleed
You’re killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I’ll ever need is You

Here in this haze a distant light 
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You’re piercing me
This self will bleed
You’re killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I’ll ever need is You</div>
This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Oh no, did I get too close
Oh, did I almost see
What's really on the inside

All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

Unconditional
Unconditionally
I will love you 

There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you
Unconditionally

Come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are all worthy

I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm I would
I do it all because I love you
I love you

Unconditional
Unconditionally
I will love you 

There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you
Unconditionally

So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart

Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me

Unconditional
Unconditionally
I will love you 
Unconditionally, yeah

There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you
Unconditionally, oh yeah

I will love you
Unconditionally
I will love you 
Unconditionally
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
Oh no no no no no no no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!
All along the western front 
People line up to receive 
She got the current in her hand 
To shock you like you won't believe 

Saw her in the Amazon 
With the voltage running throughout her skin 
Standing there with nothing on 
She's gonna teach me how to swim 

Oh, ooh, ooh 
Said, "Ooh, ooh girl shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

Said, "Ooh, girl ooh, shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

All along the eastern shore 
Put your circuits in the sea 
This is what the world is for 
Making electricity 

Cause you can feel it in your mind 
Oh you can do it all the time 
Plug it in and change the world 
Yes, you are my electric girl 

I said, "Ooh, ooh girl shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

Said, "Ooh, girl ooh, shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

Oh, oh yea 
Hey, hey 
Do what ya feel now 
Electric feel now 

Do what ya feel now 
Electric feel now 

Do what ya feel now 
Electric feel now
I take these turns a bit too fast,
Trying to leave you in my past.
The CD skips our favorite songs,
Our greatest hits just don't belong.

I really love to hate this,
Love, hate hate-love,
Relationships, are over-rated.
Over my dead body,
Is how this will end.

You said "it's over",
And I could go for,
Another chance to do,
This over again.

So this is it?
After all we've been through?
We called it quits,
And now I'm about to.
I've lost my grip,
Or the little I had left.

You said "it's over",
And I could really go for,
A cup of coffee,
And an overdose.
Leave it all behind me,
You'll see it,
When you finally find me,
Comatose or pretty close.

Cup of coffee,
And an overdose.

I pop these pills like cracker jacks,
And the price that plays dice,
Just watching you react.
When your depressed you sleep too much,
I'm not sure if i'm waking up.

It's over-rated.
Over my dead body,
Is how this will end.

You said "it's over",
And I could go for,
Another chance to do,
This over again.

So this is it?
After all we've been through?
We called it quits,
And now I'm about to.
I've lost my grip,
Or the little I had left.

You said "it's over",
And I could really go for,
A cup of coffee,
And an overdose.
Leave it all behind me,
You'll see it,

A cup of coffee,

Leave it all behind me,
You'll see it,

I stood in line,
Without you, oh-oh-oh,
Without you, I, I-I-I,
I stood in line.

I stood in line without you,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh),
And I don't tell you,
My little every thought,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh),
(I stood in line without you),
About you, well without you,
(I stood in line without you, eh),
Is everything I've got.

I stood in line without you,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh),
And I don't tell you,
(Yeah, I'll be fine as soon as I've),
My little every thought,
(Left your pretty face).
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh).
About you, well without you,
Is everything I've got.

I stood in line without you,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh).
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in Period One
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in LA
That seems to be where everybody
Else ends up these days

And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah

I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly
Agreed politely

I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancin' through the fire
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than the lion
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

... oh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancin' through the fire
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than the lion
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

... oh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're gonna hear me roar

... oh-oh-oh-ohh (hey)
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (you'll hear me roar)
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're gonna hear me roar

Roar, oh, roar, oh, roar
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter (I got the eye of the tiger)
Dancin' through the fire (dancin' through the fire)
'Cause I am the champion (yeah)
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than the lion (roar louder)
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar (you're gonna hear me roar)

... oh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (yeah)
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh 
You're gonna hear me roar (roar)

... oh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (you'll hear me roar)
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're gonna hear me roar (hear me roar)

Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock

I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock

Word on the street you got something to show me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery
I'm intrigued for a peek, heard it's fascinating
Words up your sleeve, such a tease, wanna see the show
In 3-D, a movie, heard it's beautiful
Be the judge and my girls gonna take a bow

I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biatch
I’m a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock

I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock

Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, stick it loose, come on take a shot

I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biatch
I’m a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?

Don't be a shy kind of guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock

Oh my God, no exaggeration
Boy all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear
I am so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End-of-the-rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biatch
I’m a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?

<div class="lyricbox">How could I see You when I was so blind
How could I grasp You when I was far behind
How could I hear You when I was so deaf
How could I get up when I had been left

But You said don’t worry
For I’ve healed the blind man
And I’ve set the captives free
And You said don’t worry
For all you’ve gotta do
Is put your trust in Me

How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole 
Make me whole
Make me whole again</div>
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
Oh no no no no no no no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID 
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears

And I cry
So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

I listen to these voices 
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girls bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears

Oh, and I cry
So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

Where can I go, where can I hide
from these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge

No more tears
So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...

You're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through and
Bust down the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
And my heart is still wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map that tells a story what a souvenir 
of Young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

And I cover up these scars
And I can't stop seeing stars
Whenever you're around
Around

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oohhh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

I can't stop no I can't stop
no I can't stop
Ohh, I'm going out in flames
Ohh, I'm going down in flames
Ohhhh
Baby you are the weapon I choose
Baby you are the weapon I choose...
He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know, when you know
I don't know

I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming that I could?

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah

Snow White said when I was young "one day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you cant see the sign, wait for it
One hundred percent, with every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And thats just the beginning

Oh yeah, 'cause I know you're out there
And your, your looking for me, ooh
It's a crazy idea that you were made perfectly for me
You'll see

Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending
Oh, it's not like the movies
Oh, but that's how it will be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway

No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down...
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So, if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light?
Is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life

With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes

And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night

'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive

And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now

So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now

I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now
I see through you now
Is Mercury in retrograde,
Or is that the excuse that I've always made
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself

Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

Oh, I can only take responsibility for me
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent

Oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
Let me be first, baby 
To say I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I'll face my demons - yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could, too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself

Oh, I can only be the change you want to see
Yeah, to see

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent, yeah

Oh-oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
Let me be first, baby 
To say I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror, and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way
Is it too late to change

Oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent

Oh-oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
Let me be first, baby 
To say I'm sorry
I'm sorry

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Kanye West:
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada spacesuit about the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars

Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me, what's next: alien sex
I'ma disrobe you, then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you, so I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

<div class="lyricbox">There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Ended kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure

Hello hello I'm searching for a man
With love-filled eyes and them healing hands
Hello hello I've been waiting for so long
Don't disconnect me cause it's my last call

CHORUS(1):
For help
Yeah help

'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name

Don't wanna leave, don't wanna say goodbye
Still fifteen minutes for my thirty-five
And where's this good in goodbye?
Cause talking to you is bringing me

This life
Yeah life
This life 
Yeah

'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name

'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name

This is my last call
I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
The introduced me was always just a friend,
I bought a new dress he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it

You were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
Said I was pretty and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention

Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to being loved the right way
I want to argue but there is nothing to say

Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love I think I'm ready

'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
(So scared) to feel this way

But love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love
Oh love I think I'm ready
<div class="lyricbox">Through this skin You see my heart
Through this laughter You feel my pain
Even through this mask You see my face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

Growing up never comes easily
In Your hands, You’re the potter molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

My Father 
My Father
You are my Father 
Oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry 
Even at the midnight

And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me</div>
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
Oh no no no no no no no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!

But love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love
Oh love I think I'm ready
I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be sayin' now
You know I like my boys a little bit older

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
Be undercover lovers, under the covers 

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your love, love
I just wanna use your love, love, love...

Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
But I can't stop the way I'm feeling

As you leave, please could you just close the door?
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
Go find a shoulder to cry upon 

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight...

I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love now baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all)

I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song
Singin' this song song song song song
If You came by me would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though I really didn't see
If You walked by my side would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name would never be denied

But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it 
So, spit in Your face and passed You by
I'd forgotten those words "Your name won't be denied"

But time and time again I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad but I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday, but not this day I said
I wanted to live my life I was willing to pay the price

But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it 
So, spit in Your face and passed You by
I'd forgotten those words "Your name won't be denied"

But looking into my eyes I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You bad, my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain, this guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away if I were to give you back my life?

But You said "I've forgiven thee"
And You said "I've forgiven thee" 

He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns on His head 

But You said "I've forgiven thee"
And You said "I've forgiven thee"
You could throw me in the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith is your desire
And your love endures

You could throw me in the prison cell
Shackle me up against the rail
But time and time again
My faith won't fail 

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail

You could throw me in the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace surrounds me
And it sets me free

And I can walk upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are set upon You
And no one can bring me down

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail

For His angels surround me
And you've poured out this blood covering
And I will walk and not fail
For time and time again My faith won't fail 

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail
Did it seem to disappoint you living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma, out of control
No one seems to give the answers that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here

Miles and miles of lies behind you
Those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you
Help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

Heaven waits 
The hours of silence finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

I love you 
I have and I always will

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you
Was 27, surviving my return to Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

Thought I wasn't enough
Found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore

By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh I can finally see myself again

I know I am enough
Possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the Universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

Oh
That way, no
Not in the name of love
In the name of love
That way, no
I am not giving up

By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
Looked in the mirror
By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mine
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy
All you really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I'm not fighting anymore

I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
We're cursed just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy
All you really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I'm not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway
I'm not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more 

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I'm not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more...
<div class="lyricbox">I can feel a phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there

It’s never easy to be chosen
Never easy to be called
Standing on the front line
When the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens
But I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

I can feel this light that’s inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that’s the price

It’s never easy to be chosen
Never easy to be called
Standing on the front line
When the bombs start to fall
And I can see the heavens
But I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don’t let the greatness get you down

I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
Who am I living for?</div>
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...

You're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through and
Bust down the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys

Snoop Dogg
Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

Katy Perry
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle (ooh)
Oooh oh oooh

California girls (California), we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast), now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Snoop Dogg
Toned, tan, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy my lady (yeah)
You looking here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (oh yeah)

Katy Perry
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh (c'mon, c'mon)

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast, West Coast), now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh (ey, ey)

Snoop Dogg
(California, California girls)
California girls, man
I really wish you all could be California girls
The weight of my words are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep, I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies smell like a big old bucket of bleach
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key, you won't open up for me

So brick by brick, I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

And it feels like you're in China and I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh boy, can't you just get used to something so right?
And sure I confess: I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away

So brick by brick, I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

'Cause if you give up, then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you

So brick by brick, I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not giving, giving up
Oh baby, don't give up on this love
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left to say
I'll say it all again 
But until then

And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart 
Oh, 'cause I do Jesus

No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart 
Oh, 'cause I do Jesus

When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down 'cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight

That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys

So over the summer something changed
I started reading seventeen
And shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school
And caught you staring at me

'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight

That I just wanna be
Your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream
And not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team

And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be...
'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight

That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart 
I'm wide awake 
How did I read the stars so wrong?

I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down

Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Outta the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down

Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm) Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah I'm letting you go, I'm) I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I'm wide awake
I am trying to hold on

I'm wide awake
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
(I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake

Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm) Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah I'm letting you go, I'm) I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID 
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
She is a pyramid
But with him she's just a grain of sand
This love's too strong like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in

She was a hurricane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl
Yeah, she used to rule the world
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

She was unstoppable
Moved fast just like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they never ever met

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl
Yeah, she used to rule the world
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a

Do you know that there's a way out
There's a way out, there's a way out, there's a way out
You don't have to be held down
Be held down, be held down, be held down

'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world
My world, oh yeah
But I will come and grow strong
And I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

You don't have to be a shell, no
You're the one that rules your world
You are strong and you'll learn that you can still go on
And you'll always be a pearl

She is unstoppable
<div class="lyricbox">Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach-pink lips, yeah everybody stares
(Ooh) You think you've seen her in a magazine
(Ooh) It's like she walked right out of your dreams

Black Ray Bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
(Ooh) Yeah, she runs the place like Penny Lane
(Ooh) Yeah you're lucky if you're on her plane

From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio!
That girl's a trip
A one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

She's got that je ne sais quoi, you know it
So très chic, yeah she's a classic
(Ooh) Yeah, she's footloose and so fancy free
(Ooh) Yeah, she dances to her own beat

'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
(Ooh) 'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko
(Ooh) And she's a little bit of "Oh no"

From L.A., Miami, to New York City!

A one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high

Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand

And make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take off

A one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can

I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
Oh no no no no no no no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!
This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully

'Cause I

Of anything
And everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy

Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' atcha like a dark horse

(Hey) Are you ready for, ready for

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) There's no going back

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Like a bird without a cage

But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away

So just be sure

Juicy J
She's a beast
I call her Karma
She'll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
'Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending
With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But li'l mama's so dope
I messed around and got addicted

Katy Perry

Nothing's going right
Why don't you let me 
Stop by

The clock is ticking
Running out of time
So we should party
All night

I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance
If you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call

Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

Pop your confetti
Pop the Pérignon
So hot and heavy
'Til dawn

I got you spinning 
Like a disco ball
All night they're playing
Your song

We're living the life
We're doing it right
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance
I you want it all
You know I'm the girl that you should call

Boy, when you're with me

Happy birthday</div>
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So, if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light?
Is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...

You're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through and
Bust down the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary
La, la, la, la, la

Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary
La, la, la, la, la

Ah-ooh! (Shakara) Ooh!
(Legendary lovers, legendary lovers)
Ah-ooh! (Legendary lovers, legendary lovers) Ooh!

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary
La, la, la, la, la

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Oh Baby
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary
La, la, la, la, la

Ah-ooh!
Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75
Isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more than an ex
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Ohh I won't settle no oh 
Oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history 
Rather than end up 
Begging on the streets
Trading undertable favors
For a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this 
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention

I wanna break the mold 
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it 
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints

Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints in the END
<div class="lyricbox">You would think that I could find a simple song 
A photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD 
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me you see

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways

I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

I don't regret, I'm not ashamed 
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways
As the wisest of men 
Oh, perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful 
To be a part of the family tree 
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete

Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways

Time after time 
One more time and again 
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old I am told it’s the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying

Oh, baby don’t worry about a thing</div>
