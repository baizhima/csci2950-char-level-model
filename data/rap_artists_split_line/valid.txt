but music is <unk> of self, we just explain it
and then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
how we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
who post <unk> pictures on their walls all day long
<unk> they favorite rappers and know all they songs

or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

that's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden

so, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> my first hit single
and i just took that <unk> built relationships with people, my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man, yo, i <unk> i love him for that
and at this time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had <unk> and i had relationships with all these <unk> and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, i'd play them some beats
"gimme a beat that sound like <unk> you know, they dick <unk> whatever
so i'll play them these <unk> beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit. i'll
be like, "yo but i rap <unk> hey, i guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here, i played them <unk> <unk> and they didn't sign me
you know what <unk> it was some <unk> that fucked with me though, but then like the <unk> it'd be somebody at the company that'll say <unk>
