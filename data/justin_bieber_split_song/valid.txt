yeah, oh oh

if i believe in love and you believe in love
then we can be in love somehow
if you want the best for us
like i want the best for us
then we gotta learn to trust right now

let this effort go to waste
put our all in it
want to be left with the questions, why
be honest with ourselves
did we really come this far
just to watch it go down the drain?

yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
all you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
they don't ever lie
well giving up is immature
there's so much more to live for
that i want to see us together now
'cause strong enough to endure, woah

if i believe in love and you believe in love
then we can be in love, somehow
if you want the best for us
like i want the best for us
then we got to learn to trust right now

growing pains come along with these changes
some people get closer some people separate, yeah
think we should separate
and we both adore one another
a dream come true
we should start off brand new
what we ought to do
yeah

yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
all you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
they don't ever lie
well giving up is immature
there's so much more to live for
that i want to see us together now
'cause strong enough to endure, woah

if i believe in love and you believe in love
then we can be in love somehow
if you want the best for us
like i want the best for us
then we gotta learn to trust right now

trust me right now
yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
oh, we gotta learn to trust right now
girl you gotta learn to trust me right now

'cause all those other women couldn't care less if i lived
and i'm not barely trippin' i just can't do this again
please don't tell me you're just like them
you're just like them

i know that it's hard to trust of
but you need the trust that my love
will never leave you in the dust

please don't tell me you're just like them
you're just like themshe don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
she don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
and she getting to the point where it's too much for
and she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
she can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
don't want no love in front of the camera

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

she's giving ultimatums, she don't like this live
she said if i loved her, i'd give it up won't think twice
i can't do that
and it's getting to the point where it's too much for
wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
she don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
don't want no love in front of the camera

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

why can i choose between the two
one of the nights i'll run right now
i wish she could see, how good this can be
i hope she waits a little bit longer
cause i don't wanna live life, without her by my side
cause she gets the light that is in me
but she don't know, she don't know

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don'tjustin bieber
with you
i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place

tyga
ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
every beat like a image in the background
i'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
i wanna tell you but there's too many people round
you know i love you, i care but it's unfair
i ain't perfect but i'm tryna be the best i can
if it's real than its gon' come back again
so i'm letting go, i hope you understand
all your friends say, he don't love you
and the grown ups say it's puppy
love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
that i thought
loving you, it was us against the world
you my favorite girl, for you i would go to war
i, take this all in just to show you
or maybe i'm just stuck in the moment

justin bieber
now romeo &amp; juliet
bet they never felt the way we felt
bonnie &amp; clyde
never had to hide like
we do

you and i, both know it can't work
it's all fun and games
'til someone gets hurt
and i don't
i won't let that be you

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're trippin' in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam &amp; eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny &amp; cher
i don't care
i got you baby

see we both
fightin' every inch of our fibers
'cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
we are both too foolish to stop

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
and we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
and i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
baby we both have the right to disagree
and i ain't with it
and i don't wanna be so old and gray
reminiscing 'bout these better days
but convince just telling us to let go
so we'll never know

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
'cause everything we did
and everything we have is stuck in the moment

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
(oh no no)
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
(nothing my heart can do)
to fight with time and space
(and space)
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

it's crazy how some people say, say they don't care
when there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair
it's about time for you to act merrily
it's about time for you to give to charity
rarely do people even wanna help at all
'cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls
not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
so i think some of you need to act bold
