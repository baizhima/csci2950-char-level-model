they get to first <unk>
then they get to <unk> cuz if she <unk>
he wanna know what the first <unk> is
now you like <unk>
cuz you <unk> around
and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her
i cant relate to that
i had to take it back a couple a years
when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact

i bet that they knew it cuz in my mind i play through it
with [?] and they lewis and a couple things that they true in
and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do
cuz its my <unk> my life, my <unk> for my wife
and i used to be eager to buy em the world
maybe im confused about what i desire from girls
either way im all alone, got a feelin its on
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[verse 3: drake]
check,
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is <unk>
since i aint made them a purchase yet
but theres logic behind it
emotions double and they try to cover up
like a mansion with the <unk> behind it
i tend to freak with this
i get a girl and pretend that i love the <unk>
and all she gave was a decent kiss
thinkin she been <unk>
but <unk> is nothing when you can shovel for days
and come up with tin <unk>

we could <unk> it see
you take a <unk> or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
gave her nothing
her <unk> in jeopardy
cuz it aint take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me
<unk> i look for a <unk> chick that'll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and callin and <unk> me
for thinkin that <unk> i got a feeling im wrong
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

i think i killed everybody in the game last year, man
fuck it i was on though
and i thought i found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
fuck it i was wrong though
shout out all to all my niggas living <unk> free
now-a-days it's six figures when they <unk> me
oh well, i guess you lose some and win some
long as the <unk> is <unk>
you know i want it all and then some
shout out to <unk> girls, let the lights <unk> sum
shots came, i don't know where they was sent from
probably some bad hoes about to take the <unk> from
yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah
i mean you ain't the only real nigga
they got me on these white women like seal nigga
<unk> to the pussy but i'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
are these people really <unk> my career again?
asking if i'll be going platinum in a year again
don't i got the shit the world wanna hear again?
don't michael jordan still got his hoop <unk> in?
man all of your flows bore me: paint <unk>
and i don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
and i be hearing shit you say through the <unk>
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
it's been that way from the beginning
i just been <unk> i ain't even know that i was winning
and this is the only sound you should fear
man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[hook]
i know, i know you don't love me, baby
time to take you away from me
only over my dead body...

[drake - verse 2]
you say i'm old news, where who the new star?
cause if i'm going anyway, it's probably too far
just <unk> at a bar <unk> over in the <unk>
used half of the money to beat my brother's case
red wine over fed time
and shout out to the niggas that's doing <unk>
shout out to the bitches there when it's <unk>
and fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
you and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny <unk>
don't make me break your <unk> heart boy
yeah, it's whatever. you know, feeling good, living better
i think maybe i was numb to it last year
but you know i feel it now more than ever
my city love me like mac <unk> in the bay
second <unk> i'm back <unk> the way
the <unk> are back on the <unk>
like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
and i met your baby <unk> last night
we took a picture together -- i hope she <unk> it!
and i was drinking at the palms last night
and ended up losing everything that i came with
feel like i've been here before huh?
i still got 10 years to go huh?
this is the only sound you should fear
these kids wear crowns over here
and everything is all rightwho wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
you get excitement in your bones
and everything you do's a game
when night comes and you're on your own
you can say i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

who wants to be riding high
when you'll just crumble back on down
you give up everything you are
and even then you don't get far
they make believe that everything
is exactly what it seems
but at least when you're at your worst
you know how to feel things

see when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

go ahead and steal my heart
to make me cry again
'cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
when we were both right
and no one had blame
but now i give up
on this endless game

'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my bones
even though everything's a strain
when night comes and i'm on my own
you should know i chose to be alone
so who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of...

no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of loveit's a little <unk> out there
how you can stand there is beyond me

all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need family for
'cause i can't depend on you anymore

always saw you for what you could've been
ever since you met me
like when <unk> made that one car that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you could've been
and even when it's business with you it's personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet and now we're <unk> our end

and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

you're so predictable i hate people like you
kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
how you supposed to figure out what i'm going through
you can't even figure out what's going on with you
you judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
i make all the <unk> <unk> for the real niggas
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
out here in l.a. i don't know what's going on
i don't know what's going on

and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

you sit and you pray hoping that the stars <unk>
my luck is a sure thing 'cause i'm living right
when i needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
i'm <unk> and <unk> them all like i'm working for <unk> wage
someone up there must just love testing my patience
someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
forgiveness for your ways
if i ever loved ya, i'll always love ya that's how i was raised
same way i'm right here still feeling the way
same way i'm realizing on a day to day

all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need your family for
'cause i can't depend on you anymore
much closer

anytime people want to start problems
it's like <unk> real, are you <unk>
you know who mans are
i'm not afraid no gyal heart man
and i'm not afraid of no <unk>
and i'm not afraid of no waste <unk> neither
so anybody who want it can get it
say feooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
you're bad for me
i clearly get it
i don't see how something good could come from loving you
the death of me
must be yo mission
'cause with every hug and kiss
you're <unk> every bit of strength
that i'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable
and it's a heartbreaking situation
i'm up in but i can't control

you're just like poison
slowly moving through my system
breaking all of my defences with time
you're just like poison
and i just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
i'm not sure of what to do
it's a catch-22
'cause the cure is found in you
i don't want it but i do,
you're just like poison
my affliction, i'm addicted, i can't lie
kiss me one more time before i die

you ain't right take me high
then that high, it <unk>
and my body flat lines
then you come to <unk>
wait, wait, <unk> i'm alive
but how long will it last
will it all come crashing down?
how many <unk> am i needing now?
what's the <unk> will you be around?
or am i just another victim of an <unk> that broke my heart down?

baby you're just like poison
slowly moving through my system
breaking all of my defences with time
you're just like poison
and i just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
i'm not sure of what to do
it's a catch-22
'cause the cure is found in you

i didn't mean to hurt you, but i know,
in the game of love, you reap what you sow

and i'm wishing on a dreamit was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
all dressed in <unk> going to the church that night
she had his box of letters in the passenger seat
<unk> in her shoe
something <unk> something blue

and when the church doors opened up wide
she put her <unk> down trying to hide the tears
oh she just couldn't believe it
she heard the <unk> from the <unk> band
and the flowers fell out of her hand

baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now,
this can't be happening to me
this is just a dream

the preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
lord please lift his soul and heal this <unk>
then the congregation all stood up and sang
the <unk> song, that she ever heard
and then they handed her a <unk> up flag

and she held on to all she had left of him
oh and what could've been
and then the guns <unk> one last shot
and it felt like a bullet in her heart

baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now,
this can't be happening to me
this is just a dream

oh baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know,
oh i'll never know

it's like i'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now,

and it cut me like a knife
when you walked out of my life
now i'm, in this condition
and i've, got all the symptoms
of a girl with a broken heart
but no matter what you'll never see me cry

did it happen when we first kissed
cause it's hurting me to let it go
maybe cause we spent so much time
and i know that it's no more
i shoulda never let you hold me baby
maybe why i'm sad to see us apart
i didn't give to you on purpose
gotta figure out how you stole my heart

my mind is gone, i'm spinning round
and deep inside, my tears i'll drown
i'm losing grip, what's happening
i stray from love, this is how i feel

this time was different
felt like, i was just a victim
and it cut me like a knife
when you walked out of my life
now i'm, in this condition

she was goin' way too fast
before she knew it she was <unk>
on a thin black <unk> of glass
she saw both their lives flash before her eyes
she didn't even have time to cry

she threw her hands up in the air

take it from my hands
'cause i can't do this on my own
i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
just save me from this road i'm on

when she made it to the shoulder
and the car came to a stop
she cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
sleepin' like a rock
but for the first time in a long time
she <unk> her head to pray
she said, "i'm sorry for the way
i've been livin' my life

i never turn the heat off
and still i'm so chilli <unk> <unk>
these silly billies really feel to act as if they know drake
always gossipin' callin' and <unk>
magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ <unk>
tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
how i am no good so go with the next man
but dog
you don't know me
you don't know us
we go by the name of a-t-f
and any previous affiliation
they know to hold they tongue and i spare 'em humiliation
i know you in and out
nigga i am not playin'
just fall back keep on escape'in and alize'in
and stop tryna act like you like me and my team
not us so you knock us
that's <unk> what i mean

it's all in a day's work that's what i am on
<unk> <unk> viacom
and who's continental gt is outside

so i am what they gotta be
'cause drake's <unk> is like jake gyllenhaal

i been brainwashed to kill 'em all
i think i should pass my own amendment
you frontin' with glass all in your <unk>
you ain't livin' rapper you never have been
you a has-been a gas station attendant
your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
i'm clearin' the air i'm a humidifier
i'm spittin' fire
and gettin' flyer
and what you <unk> for this summer i did it <unk>
i've shattered shows
and <unk> clothes
met status <unk>
this is the south and i am present when it matters most
the <unk> hot but pay attention to my latter flows
givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that <unk>

and drink dom
they always ask me "is that a <unk>
