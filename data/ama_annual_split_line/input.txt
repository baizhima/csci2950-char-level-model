Well, life's been kind of trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and my Bob Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for nigh on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare

But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County affair)

Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy, she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air

She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hand trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere (Choctaw County affair)

Well, I do not deny I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear

But there's nobody, there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware (Choctaw County affair), 
Yeah yeah-yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
We were live-or-die, hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

But the foreman of the jury told me "honey, don't you worry"
It's a Choctaw county affair, yeah
(Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair), yeah
How would you know 'cause you weren't there? (Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, yeah (Choctaw County affair)
If I'm thinking for two
I've got a lot of sweet drinking up to do
He reminds me of a drummer that I once knew
Just passing through

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I cancelled that call
I thought about it and I want it all
So I picked up the pieces you left on the floor
And went out for more

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I know that we took them by surprise
And I know we were right before their eyes
And it's about time
Yeah it's about time

So I walked through the door
They looked right at me, but could not ignore
And the drinks were expensive, stories were told
And I had a ball

And I cancelled that call
You though about it and you want it all
So you picked up the pieces I left on the floor
And walked out that door

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I know that we took them by surprise
And I know we were right before their eyes
And it's about time
Yeah it's about time
Swear to you, Lord
Same dudes that used to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a B
They know that money begets money, so naturally
Me, I have to blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like f*ck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two partners in that caprice
With no copies made, I got the master keys
and fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mold you rappers like plaster, see
I have the dreams but dog, me and success are two things
you don't wanna find your ass between
back against the wall like a plasma screens
the inside of my wallet is pasture green
and you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while is smash the scene
I should leave Earth, it's nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is new years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
and with me, women be building these skeptical walls
but once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all.
Family, money and music is all I ever knew
My neck will suffer from depression,
it is forever blue
cheer up baby, You don't see all this revenue
I started the game at level two, I'm saying
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market,
I parallel flying spur Tony Park it,
And it's cool if you spill something it's only carpet
that's why I get my interior colors only dark shit
If Toronto's where you living today,
then you ain't making records the people are driven to play.
I would advise you to really make a move
sooner than later.
Cause these are only the joints
I'm giving away
you feel me?
What just happened?
Did you kiss me?
'Cuz that's a place we've never been
Until now
And I dunno
How we're gunna be after this
Do we pretend these feelings don't exist at all?
Or do we fall?

My confusion shows
Whenever you
Stand so close
I stumble
I stutter
Forget what to say
I'm nervous
I wonder why I'm acting this way

(Chorus)
It's temporary insanity
What going on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?
Woh-oh-oh (x2)

You made a move
Don't change your mind
Too much to lose
We've crossed the line
Between friends and something more
Was it all a big mistake?
'Cuz if it was it's much too late to undo
And I don't really want to

Let you go
But I still don't know
How I feel about you
What this really means
It's crazy to want you
Is it meant to be?

Its temporary insanity
What's goin' on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?(x2)
Woh-oh-oh(x2)

Hey what you do to me
What's come over me?
If this is crazy
There's nothing I'd rather be
Than here with you now
Let's figure this out

Here with you now(x2)
Its temporary insanity
What goin' on with you and me
Is it real or is it fantasy?
Forever or just temporary?(x2)

(Losin' my mind)(x2)
(What's goin' on?)
(Losin my mind)(x3)

Insanity
What you do to me
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white, going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue

And when the church doors opened up wide 
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
Oh she just couldn't believe it 
She heard the trumpets from the military band 
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream

The preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang 
The saddest song, that she ever heard 
And then they handed her a folded up flag

And she held on to all she had left of him 
Oh and what could've been 
And then the guns rang one last shot 
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream

Oh baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know,
Oh I'll never know

It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream

Oh this is just a dream
This is just a dream
Yeah yeah
Oh, oh oh ohoh
(And I pray)

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Ooh, I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray yeah
I close my eyes and...

I pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls that need a break
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (and I pray)
I close my eyes and I pray (oh)
ohohoh

I pray (oh, and I pray)
I pray

I close my eyes and pray
Here we lay face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
and I'm wondering who will be the first 
to say what we both know
We're just holding on to could have beens
and we should be letting go.

(Chorus:)
It feels like you're a million miles away 
as your lying here with me tonight 
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right 
and we both know that the story's ending, 
we play the part but we're just pretending 
and I can hide the tears 
cause even though you're here, 
it feels like you're a million miles away.

Was it me, or was it you that broke away? 
From what we were just like the seasons love has changed
And every I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.

(Chorus:)
(Music Plays:)
(Bridge)
We can try to talk it over 
but we walked that road before
boy, our song has played its last note
And we both know for sure 
that it's time to close that door.

(Chorus:)
I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone

And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know
What that means, I know

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat

But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then, you'll never understand

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

We've turned our hands to guns
Trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you
Of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers
To my head

The solution is
I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest
And this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them
To turn their guns to a fist

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

Hello you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, dashboard drummers
Hello you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom

There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

I stood at the bottom of some walls I thought I couldn't climb
I felt like Cinderella at the ball just running out of time
So I know how it feels to be afraid
Think that it's all gonna slip away
Hold on, hold on

Here's to you free souls, you firefly chasers
Street climbers, porch swingers, air guitar players
Here's to you fearless dancers, shaking walls in your bedrooms

There's a lot of wonder left inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

Never let a bad day be enough
To go and talk you in to giving up
Sometimes everybody feels like you
Oh, feels like you, just like you
Yeah

I've met some go-getters
Some difference makers
Small town heroes and, big chance takers
I've met some young hearts with something to prove
Oh, yeah

You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, and dashboard drummers
Here's to you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom

There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you

I could write a song with my new piano;
I could sing about how love is a losing battle...
Not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
It's not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)

In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's so hard... (It's so hard...)
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance - don't it make you wanna dance?
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand...

So hold up and take it through the night,
And you should follow through to make it alright...
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano...

On the first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me please, and never let me go
On the second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me
That promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

On the third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said I love you and meant it (ah, ah, ah)
On the fourth we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got a tattoo on my heart
Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
And nothing's shining more than you, boy

You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million (ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, you are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
&lt;/poem&gt;

<div class="lyricbox">I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
I know you're loco

They say you shouldn’t sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so irresistible
I had to break the rules
Your temper can be sexy
I love it when you hate me

It’s out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you’re loco
But feels too good, yo

They say you shouldn’t sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you’re so unforgettable
I had to break the rules
Your eyes are like a weapon
They’d kill me if I let ‘em

It’s out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you’re loco
But feels too good, yo

But it feels too good, yeah</div>
You're everything I thought you never were 
And nothing like I thought you could've been 
But still you lived inside of me 
So tell me how is that 

You're the only one I wish I could forget 
The only one I loved and not forgive 
And though you've break my heart 
You're the only one 

And though there are times when I hate you 
Cause I can't erase 
The times that you hurt me 
And put tears on my face 
And even now I hate you it pains me to say 
I know I'll be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl, no no 
No broken-hearted girl 

I'm no broken-hearted girl 
There's something that I feel I need to say 
But up 'til now I've always been afraid 
That you would never come around 
And still I wanna put this out 
You say you got the most respect for me 
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me 
And still you're in my heart 
But you're the only one 

And yes there are times when I hate you 
But I don't complain 
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away 
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say 
That I will be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you babe 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh 
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah 
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free 
To spread my wings and fly away 
Away without you
 
Yeah yeah yeah, oh ohh... 

I don't wanna be without my baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 
Broken-hearted girl, no, no 
No broken-hearted girl 
No broken-hearted girl
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom.

Now the pain is my pleasure
'Cause nothing could measure (oh oh oh oh oh)

Love is great, love is fine  (oh oh oh oh oh)
Outta box, outta line (oh oh oh oh oh)
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more (oh oh oh oh oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and 'til this day that's what you see

I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And mama said you cried the whole way home

You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

I've got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love

'Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

Oh woah, oh woah
The girl you think I am
Yeah ooh, ooh yeah

All I want more than anything
Is to make you proud of me

'Cause you think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You believe in me, yeah you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am
I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Gets you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys

Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive

I got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got all the drive but a whole lotta boom in the back
If you look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy I wish you would

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Gets you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys

Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive

'Cause your Maybach, ain't got what I got (get it get it)
Don't stop, it's a sure shot
Ain't your Ferrari, huh, boy I'm sorry
I ain't even worried
So step inside and ride
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride...)

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Gets you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night

'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys

Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive

Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive
Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you
Whatcha gonna do when the show is over?
Whatcha gonna sing when the song ends?
Yeah, how you gonna cope when there is no closure?
Where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher?
How you gonna make it through when you think you lost your chance?

Play on when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even when the floodgates swing wide open
Never let the currents take you down, no
Even when you're not sure where you're going
Swimming through a mess and you can't get out
Just going through the motions and trying not to drown

Play on when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even through a storm on the darkest night
Don't you ever give up the fight
Even when you feel you're all alone
Play on, play on

Play on when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Play on
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh-oh oooh ooh-ooh-ooh

You walk and talk like you're some new sensation,
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation.
You spend your money, you can get no satisfaction,
You play it right so you can get the right reaction.

It won't be long, my darling.
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it.
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for.

You (you), when you're falling down, the world starts spinning round.
You (you), when you're falling down, now it's not all about.
You (you), when you're falling down, you know I'll be around.
You're falling down, falling down.

(Falling down, you're falling down, falling down)
Without a place you're lookin in the mirror?
The truth is blurry but the lies are gettin' clearer.
Your eyes are fixed, your smile is so elastic.
You give me roses but they're all just made of plastic.

It won't be long, my darling.
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it.
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for.

You (you), when you're falling down, the world starts spinning round.
You (you), when you're falling down, now it's not all about.
You (you), when you're falling down, you know I'll be around.
You're falling down, falling down.

Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at ya,
Smile for the camera if they're all about to trash ya.
Smile for the camera (camera, camera) 
Smile for the camera, who's gonna catch ya?

You (you)
You (you), when you're falling down, the world starts spinning round.
You (you), when you're falling down, now it's not all about.
You (you), when you're falling down, you know I'll be around.
You're falling down, falling down

Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at you,
Smile for the camera 'cause they're all about to trash ya.
Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'
And I shouldn't believe in
The dreams that I'm dreamin'

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Tell me, Tell me something I don't know

Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing
The life I'm pursuing
The odds I'll be losing
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million, no
One in a billion, oh
One in a zillion

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know, Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Selena hit the track
Like Katrina makin' waves
Like Cold Medina, make 'em say
"I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)
Really ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)

I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say
It won't be easy

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Something I don't know

I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always going to be the same
Oh, no, you'll never change

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star, I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star, I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

Shine bright like a diamond (oh)

Shine bright like a diamond, oh yeah

Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shine bright like a diamond
Believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Believe...

There were days when out you spoken, you know
There were night when I was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from falling
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

Where would I be, if you, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel
Touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel
Touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe

Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby

No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Because
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel

Tell me do you want to ride
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
You ride around in that H-town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because
You're

You say you like New York better than L.A. 

And I just sit there
I believe that you like looking like a Ramone
And I would rather kiss a Beach Boy
Feel the sand beneath my toes
And feel the sun burn up my nose
I'll give you all of my black clothes
Just light your smoke and watch me go
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully 
And maybe then you'll see
That this time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
'Cause I'm so sick of dreary winters
And mornings spent in subway stations
Going to a job I hate
More and more with every day
I want the lifestyle of the rich and famous
While you prefer to remain nameless
But that's you, hey, and this is me
I'm gonna live the fantasy
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully
And maybe then you ll see
That this time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, next year, I won't, be here
You say you like New York better than L.A. 
And I just sit there
I believe that you like looking like a Ramone
When I would rather kiss a Beach Boy
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully
And maybe then you'll see
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully
And maybe then you'll see
That this time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, next year, I won't, be here
This time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, this time, next year, next year
I won't be here
This time, next year, I won't, be here
Come come come again?
What was that you said?
Listen carefully
And maybe then you'll see...
You're gonna run out of cigarettes
And we're gonna run out of wine
We haven't even started the good stuff yet
It's okay, we've got plenty of time
So pull up a comfortable chair, baby
And put on those records that drive me crazy
You look so good in this light
Oh yeah, you look like nothing but mine

I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
'Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Oh, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again

Let's make this night last forever
Like honey dripping sweet and slow
Every kiss just tasting better
Every touch, every whisper, let go

I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
'Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again

I wanna love you like the rain on a roof
Stronger than a bottle of 110 proof
I wanna take love to places that love has never been
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
And I'll love you again and again
You will never know what's behind my skull
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

You will never know what's under my hair
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

You will never know what's under my skin
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

You will never know what is in my veins
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

Won't you go to someone else's dreams
Won't you go to someone else's head
Haven't you taken enough from me
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

And you will never know what I'm thinking of
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

And you will never understand what I believe
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.

Haven't you taken enough from me
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?
Won't you go to someone else's dreams
Won't you go to someone else's head.
Haven't you taken enough from me
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I
Don't know where I should go
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply
Taking time in a simple place
In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase
And it's said that a war's lead but I forget
That I let another day go by
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days
I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep.
I wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works
Yelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words
I take my face off at the door 'cause I don't know who they will take me for
I wonder if I tell them what I did last night
Whether or not I got caught, they just might
Wage war on you, therefore it's true
That I shot my general on my side of enemy lines

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I'm not trying to be lying to you
But it takes a clever guy to do what I do
It takes some chivalry and well placed energy
To subliminally get yourself inside you
Introspection is the name of this session
Spread this infection, reflect it on the next one
The next one, the next one, and when we're done
We'll all have made something new under the sun
I'm not done, I'm not done yet, no
Kick me off the stage and take my microphone
Then you'll walk up to me and when you get close
I'll look you in the face and say, "Where's your home?
Where are you going and why are you here?"
Have you asked these questions? Have you been sincere?
Want to know what I believe, it's right here
Dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I'm the son of all I've done
I'm the sons of all I've done
Impostor been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood

I will tell you what I can
But your mind will take a stand
I sing of a greater love
Let me know when you've had enough

I will tell you what I can
But your mind will take a stand
I sing of a greater love
Let me know when you've had enough

I will tell you what I can
But your mind will take a stand
I sing of a greater love
Let me know when you've had enough
Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Taste me, taste me, taste me
Show me, show me, show me
The way to your heart

Oh, my baby, baby
I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle
That's right where I'ma start

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
(Our bodies touching while you)

Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, love me, love me
Be all you desire

Pretty baby, baby
I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now
And I'll take you higher

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
(Kissing on your neck while you)

Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Alright, ok
Right there, that way
'Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it

Be glad, don't say a word
Don't say no, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in a van, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're tryna snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me, do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what you'd choose
(You'd choose me, right?)

Love me like you do
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

What am I to do?
Love me like you do, you do
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Love me tight and don't let go

Love me like you do, do, do, do, do
Love me like you do, do, do, do, do, do, do...
Yeah, yeah...
<div class="lyricbox">Alright let's go

There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl

Il y a des mots qu'aujourd'hui on se dit
Mais qui nous font du tord
Et qui ne valent rien quand on les retient
Et ça rien que pour y croire encore
Tu gardes les mots qui restent intacts
Et les larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi
There'll be the one less lonely girl

Ohh (oh oh)
Aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
(No no)
C'est avec toi que je veux être plus que tout
And when you're mine in the world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
Je me tiens devant toi
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas
(That's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Mais ça n'est qu'un souvenir dans ta vie
Il y a trop d'espace entre vous
Même les heures passées à toujours penser
Ne servent à rien après tout
Et tellement de mots perdus sur des pages
Et des larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi
There'll be the one less lonely girl

Ohh (oh oh)
Aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
(No no)
C'est avec toi que je veux être plus que tout
And when you're mine in this world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
Je me tiens devant toi
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas
(That's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Il faut seulement que tu t'en sortes
Il faut que tu passes la porte pour que je te délivre
Tu n'as seulement qu'à le dire plus fort
(Free to fall)
Un peu plus fort
(Fall in love)
Je prie pour qu'aujourd'hui tu commences ta vie
Avec moi je promets
You'll be one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(One less lonely girl)
One less lonely (One less lonely)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(One less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
Je me tiens devant toi
Tu peux marcher dans mes pas

If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl

Only you shawty</div>
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Whoa

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Halooo, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Open the slits in your face and start your day 
You don't have much time to make your slits look just right 
I'm in your mind 
I'm singing 
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da 

Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you're alright 
Put out the glitter that your soul hides behind 
You're in my mind 
I'm singing 
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da 

Nowhere were they holy 
Open up your eyes and see 
The clouds above will hold you 
The clouds above will sing 

And in your mind 
You're singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da-da
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call the referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances

Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me, oh no
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
Oh! 
Oooooh

I love to see you walk into the room 
Body shining, lightin' up in the place 
And when you talk everybody stop 
'Cuz they know you know just what to say and 
The way that you protect your friends 
Baby, I respect you for that 
And when you roll you take everyone you love along 
I love that shit

Don't fly me away 
You don't need to buy a diamond key 
To unlock my heart 
You shelter my soul 
You're my fire when I'm cold 
I want you to know... 

You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
You had me at hello (Hello) 
It was many years ago (Ago) 
Baby, when you, stole my cool (stole my cool) 
Cuz you had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
Hello oooooh 

I get so excited when you travel with me, baby, while I'm on my grind 
And never will I ever let my hustle come between me and my family time and... 
You keep me humble out of this hype 
'Cuz you know there's more to life 
And if I need ya, you will be here, you will make the sacrifice 

Don't fly me away 
You don't need to buy a diamond key 
To unlock my heart 
You shelter my soul 
You're my fire when I'm cold 
I want you to know... 

You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
You had me at hello (Hello) 
It was many years ago (Ago) 
Baby, when you stole my cool (stole my cool)
You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
Hello oooooh 

Gotta feel you
And be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you
Wanna show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so... hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same

You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello) 
You had me at hello (Hello) 
It was many years ago (Ago) 
When you stole my cool (stole my cool)
You had me at hello (Hello) 
Hello (Hello)
Hello oooooh

It was many years ago 
Baby, when you stole my cool 
You had me at hello 
Hello 
Hello oooooh
I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
Baby you bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
Harder baby, harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I miss you, I miss you
(Verse 1)
Baby boy what you done to me
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got a bad boy I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you and not to mention good love that you give to me I think about it constantly no I
won't apologize for feeling like I do it's just the simple facts of life Im crazy over you

(Chorus)
Im a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day Im addicted to what your giving me boy
it's killing me when it comes to love Im not trying share you might think Im greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world cause Im a selfish girl

(Verse 2)
I understand that you got your crew but I've got something in mind for you make you lose all track of
time guaranteed to blow your mind I don't care what anybody got to say maybe they never had it quite this
way let them talk and criticize they all need to recognize They might see Im a bit extreme to need you
night and day but what I feel can't be consealed there ain't no other way

(Chorus)
Im a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day Im addicted to what your giving me boy
it's killing me when it comes to love Im not trying share you might think Im greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world cause Im a selfish girl

(Bridge)
Boy you got me trippin
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (crazy)
So amazing (so amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding
Im not playing boy (Im not playing boy)
Im just saying boy
They might see Im a bit extreme to need you night and day but what I feel can't be consealed there ain't
no other way

(Bridge and fade)
<div class="lyricbox">[Intro: Drake talking]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-trãn had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
'Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
'Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Fillipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it 'cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table 
And say "my baby's famous and I knooow it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' tooo it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video 
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
For too many rappers and not enough __
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my (Craig David) shit the (Artful Dodger)
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

[Chorus]</div>
<div class="lyricbox">You can stand beside the madness like a falling piece
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Just close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It’ll be alright, they’re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise</div>
Mybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
That's makin' me feel this way tonight
Maybe it's the words you left unsaid
Maybe it's the stardust in my head

But I wanna tell you
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby

Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
That's making all the pieces fit
Makin' it all make perfect sense

But I wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby

Oh, yeah
Goes by so fast
Can't get it back
There ain't no time
Like this time

Yeah, I just wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby

My little baby
Oh, yeah
Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill, yeah, yeah
<div class="lyricbox">Si yo fuera un chico, 
sólo por una vez.
Yo me vestiría como quiero, 
con lo que vea primero y me voy.

Saldría a buscar,
chicas por montón.
Mis amigos que son leales,
siempre van acompañarme hasta el fin,
cada noche a mentir.

Si yo fuera un chico, 
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor,
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Si yo fuera un chico,
pero ves no lo soy.
Los chicos son de molde,
y nosotras somos de corazón.

Se piensan que son,
los del sexo superior.
Pero cuando lo queremos,
los vence nuestra seducción, seducción.

Si yo fuera un chico,
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor, 
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Es muy tarde, ya ves, para regresar.
Perdonarte otra vez,
ya no lo vas a lograr.
El lugar que ocupabas tu,
ya no está más.

Pero eres un chico, qué le vas hacer.
No puedes comprender,
que se siente al comprender mejor,
y amar en serio a una mujer.

No sabes escuchar.
No te importa el dolor.
Hasta que pierdes a quién quieres,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Pero eres un chico...</div>
<div class="lyricbox">[Verse 1]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

[Bridge]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

[Bridge]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder

About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass.
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last...

[Hook]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship

All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner

Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim

We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
'Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state

Can't see her play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "That ain't true."

All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in

Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe

And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell "Girl, that shit crazy!"
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies</div>
Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
'Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
<div class="lyricbox">I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me
Of who I killed
Inside my dream
I hate this car
That I'm driving
There's no hiding for me

I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence</div>
Oh oh, oh oh
It's JB (JB)

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya
Above ya

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong (belong)
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya
Above ya

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
If I begged and if I cried 
Would it change the sky tonight 
Would it give me some light 
Should I wait for you to call? 
Is there any hope at all 
Are you drifting by? 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you I, can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 

And when I lie all by myself 
I see your face, I hear your voice 
My heart stays faithful 
And time has come and time has passed 
If its good it's got to last 
It feels so right 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 
You, you disappear 

I missed all the signs 
One at a time you were ready 
What did I know starting our lives 
Now my love, I'm ready to shine 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
You disappear, you disappear 
You disappear, disappear
I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours boy
The way your body moves across the floor
You got me feelin' n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

Baby the minute I feel your energy
The vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

I love to love you baby

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Repeat to end]
Please don't stop the music

It's getting late
I'm making my way over to
My favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up in here, looking like you do
You make and staying over here, impossible
Baby, Ima say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

Baby are you ready 'cuz it's gettin' close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us no - one has to know
This is a private show

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music


I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

I'd rather be smoking weed
Whenever we breathe
Everytime you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me

Don't know why just know I want to
Don't know why just know I want you

I'd rather be breaking things
Cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes
Here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?
Don't care why, just know I love you
[Rihanna]
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No...)

[Ne-Yo]
But you wont let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did

[Rihanna]
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong

[Ne-Yo]
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Rihanna]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oooh whoa...)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oooh...)

[Ne-Yo]
You completely know the power that you have
the only one that makes me laugh

[Rihanna]
Said and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right

[Ne-Yo]
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

[Both]
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak...
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...

[Ne-Yo]
Yeaahhh... oohh...

[Rihanna]
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, need you)
That's how much I need you

And I hate that I love you soooo...
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no...)
And I hate that I love you so

[Both]
And I hate that I love you so... soo.
Lately I've been thinkin',
Thinkin' bout what we had,
And I know it's hard,
it was all that we knew

Have you been drinkin'?
To take all the pain away,
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

'Cuz nothing can ever
Ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You'd know there's no one
I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storms
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together, mm

I gave you everything baby
Everything I had to give
Girl why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion
Like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
But that is the past now
We didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be

Tell me, was it worth it?
We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storms
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together, mm

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storms
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together, oh
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
You weakly entertainin
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'mma bout to paint a picture
You niggahs go ahead frame it
Since we gettin sinfeld
With that jerry and elaine shit...
I flow far from medeocer
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck a 54
So it's obvious ya'll be steady rollin with some jokers
And me? I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn. can you niggahs get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the ebarresement, don't even aproch her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
(ughh) and I was praying I would drop june,
But label reps applying preasure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for pet sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a clecha
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake
I'll be in your face,
Like "no speak a la engliash"
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll material motives
Cause if you like it ya'll shud stick with me
My money good, I ain't neva had to flip a key
Alotta ice, alotta cream like dickey d
Might cut the phone and disapear like mishy me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a harry bendale like it's slippery
And your ex mans a hatter oficialy
Probably cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah... that's the reason why he looking hard
Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just made cause his gurls at the house
With her tounge stickign out,
Like a Michael Jordan rookie hard
Let me addrres this, parden me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just pocking a body with a stick
Now a days rapping is a childrens hobby
And grils keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I gotta buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I try'd to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pump me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionare shades, fade with the waves
I smurk at a niggah if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every niggah except trey...
(eyy) I'm outta here baby, they asked me about the past years and how does it phaze me
I wudnt take it back, naww not if they pay me
Unless you betcha that's expencive cause it's not a?
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggahs some hope
You put the yay beat and put that shit in a joke
Well... I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Niggah keep your two cents I ain't trynna leave you broke
Life of a don, lights keep gloown
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm...
And heres another hit barry bonds
<div class="lyricbox">Stir it up, porridge
Getting dope, so rich
Ah smoke it
And I ain't never liked a broke bitch
I don't never fuck with ya hoe bitch
Quiet down

Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eyes low , I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch

Take it off
Wanna see you work it like oh my god
And that thing is out I know you know
And you bounce it like I know you know
Bitch I know you know
Bitch I know
Like wow
All my haters so so broke
Pipe down
All these niggas so so broke
So so broke

Oh-oh-oh shit
So loaded

Eyes, pose bitch</div>
Once was a time you and i 
Made a promise till the day we die 
I trusted each and every word 
Never thinkin that I'd get burned 
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales 
Boy i thought that i knew you so very well 
But you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried 
And it cuts like a knife 

(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Theres only time to say goodbye 

Fooled me once shame on you 
Fooled me twice now this song is through 
The things you said i can never forget 
The things you did for my heart went through bad 
But im still standin tall as i walk away 
And you know that its true when you hear me say 
Its over, its through 
And nothin you can do boy its sad but its true 

(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Theres only time to say goodbye 

Good Byeee No Baby 
Silly me i believed in your fairy tales 
Boy i thought that i knew you so very well 
But you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried 
And it cuts..like a knife 

(Hook)

Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this

So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear

Theres no time 
To give it one more try

Theres only time to say goodbye 

Baby goodbye 
Never gunna never gunna cry no more 
Goodbye goodbye

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Oh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go

Don’t let this go to your head
But you’re the best, I’ve ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance

Something like a zip-loc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh, so hard walking out
You got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, no
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, no

Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don’t know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Oh, when you got me in a gridlock
What a great spot
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won’t stop no
So hard walking out
You got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go, oh baby

Holdin' back the faces I would make
I’m a fan and you’re the rock star
Makin' it hard on me
Visualize a monster
'Cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow, I’m hit
Need you right near me
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away (no no)
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight ooh
Them lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go
Lips won’t let me go, oh

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go</div>
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing 'cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Anytime people want to start problems
It's like "for real, are you dumb?"
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Say fe
Damn, that was so good, I wanna buy him a short set...

(Hey.)

Uh-I'ma be like a waffle cone that's dripping down to the floor...

Say you love me as much as I love you
Would you hurt me baby?
Could you do that to me yeah?
Would you lie to me baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more

Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?
I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you

That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind

'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

Oh baby, I know lovin' you ain't easy
But it sure is worth a try

Ohhh if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard... are there any rules baby?
If this is a lesson, then baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do, just to stay right next to you

I can't help it I'm just selfish, there's no way that
I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me I just
Die in your arms, oh it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

Basically I'm saying here, I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me
Ain't no need for contemplating, promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me baby I'm all that you need

If i could just die in your arms,
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms, oh it feels so right
So baby baby please dont stop girl

If I could die in your arms.
(Gonna make you believe girl)
I wouldn't mind

Ay ay ayyyy. Don't stop baby, no.
It's what you do to me yeah
Woahhh oh no no no
Baby please don't go girl noooooooo
(I want to...) Ah, ah, ah...

You know what I want, I know what you don't,
I should be the one you love
Boy, you got my mind, playing truth or dare,
Daring me to kiss you right here

But we've been friends so long and it seems so wrong,
And everyone can see you're perfect for me,
But I just can't let it show... oh...

I've been thinkin' about you;
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know...
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we get too close...
Ah, ah, ah - boy, if we get too close... (I want you)
Ah, ah, ah - (I-I-I'm) down if we get too close...

Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great...
So what would you do, what would you say
If I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long and it seems so wrong,
And everyone can see you're perfect for me,
But I just can't let it show...

I've been thinkin' about you;
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know...

Ah, ah, ah - boy, if we get too close... (I want you)
Ah, ah, ah - (I-I-I'm) down if we get too close...

(I want to...) Ah, ah, ah...
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Burn, oh
Oh, no
Let it burn, oh
Let it burn

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby, take a chance or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag, swag, swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue
I don't know about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't ever wanna fight yeah, you already know
I'm a make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow
Burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the w-w-world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook like a whirlwind
Swaggy

I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone

So give me a chance, 'cause you're all I need girl
Spend a week with your boy I'll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man (If I was your man), I'd never leave you girl
I just want to love and treat you right

If I was your boyfriend (boyfriend), never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone (never be alone)
I can be a gentleman (gentleman), anything you want
If I was your boyfriend (boyfriend), I'd never let you go, never let you go

Na na na, na na na, na na na
Yeah girl
Na na na, na na na
If I was your boyfriend
Na na na, na na na, na na na yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na ey
If I was your boyfriend
Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh the ideas funny, oh the ideas funny
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for homerun every time

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road and the East end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl

Never say never
(never, never, never)

Yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never

Ne-never say never

I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (never say never) I will fight
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!)
I got ya little bro
I can handle him
Hold up
I, I can handle him

Jaden Smith
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never
I will never say never
(never say it, never say it)
Say never
I will fight till forever
(okay, okay)
To make it right

Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
And never say never
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never

(Chorus:)
Something bout the way that you workin me,
teasin me, pleasing me, easily boy, I'm addicted to you
Got a have ya for all the things that u do
It something bout this feeling, it's crazy,
amazing that stays with me all night and day,
Makes my temperature rise
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like i'm captured by the touch of your hand
Its so vibe it's your style it the way the that u smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, its electric, this felling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried ??

(Chorus:)
You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin' but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast i'm a afraid can't escape there's no way
Never had a feeling like this b4

(Chorus:)
It's amazing how u drive me crazy
Boy keep doin' what you're doin'
Cause you're really gettin through to me
Day and night babe u know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and u know u got me hypnotized

(Chorus:)
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na oh na na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

[Hook]
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby here I go again

[Chorus]
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize this happenin'
Baby here I go again

Here I Go Again
[Verse 2]
Still remember how you make me weak
How so hard to find the words to speak
I just cant excape the memories
I tried but I just cant break free
But I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

[Hook]
[Chorus]
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Would you let it go?

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh

Why is everything, with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I,
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh why? (Oh why)

Sometimes I get you, sometimes I don't understand.
Sometimes I love you, sometimes it's you I can't stand.
Sometimes I wanna hug you, sometimes I wanna push you away.
Most times I wanna kiss you, other times punch you in the face

And every minute you start switching up
And you say things like, "You don't give a fuck!"
Then I say, "I'm through with you." Take my heart from you. 
And you come running after me, and, baby, I'm back with you.

Oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh

Why is everything, with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh why? (Oh why)

Sometimes I catch you, Sometimes you get away
Sometimes I read you, Other times I'm like, 'Where are you on the page?'
Sometimes I feel like we will be together for---ever
But you're so complicated my heart knows better

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I ha---te it
Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh, why (Oh Why)

I'mma stick around just a little while longer.
Just to make sure, that you're really sure, you like sleeping alone

Why is everything, with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh why? (Oh why)

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh

'Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself "why do you worry?"
You know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Drake - Verse 1]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Hook]
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Drake - Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together -- I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got 10 years to go huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right
You're my bad boy fairytale
Since jamming with the dark side
I wanna be your bad girl
You bring out my wild side
Your eyes your lips your touch
His talk, sadistic rush, your sexy kinda swag
The best i've ever had

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but im loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe
No I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I cant go back, no, I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was

You're my bad boy fairytale
My rebel with a halo
You hit me like a hurricane
And I can never say no
Your mind you hands your voice
The way you make me yours, you
Your sexy kinda swag
The best i've ever had

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but im loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe
No I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I cant go back, no, I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I cant go back, no, I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was (to the way it was)

I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side
You bring out my dark side

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but im loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe
No I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I cant go back, no, I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was
No I cant go back, no, I cant go back to the way it was, to the way it was (to the way it was)

I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side
(Chorus)

No no no
You don't love me and I know now
You don't love me so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby
I shoulda left you along time ago, no

(Verse 1)
Playas gonna play
A least thats what they say
Well I know that for myself now
(You know I love you)
You said you loved me babe
Then you played your game
A game that I know all to well now
Well I use to buy your lines
But it's time for me to sail now

(Chorus)
(Rap)
First you tellin me no
But please tell me yes
Without some of this stress
Straight up tell me yes
Gimme the keys to ya chest
Ya chest will rise neva rest
As ya chest you got me feelin like i'm climbin on Mount Everest
Hey Rihanna 
Your lovin really put me to the test
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest
So please say yes
No no no

(Verse 2)
Haters gonna hate
(let them hate)
I found out much to late
I think I know were a little hot now
The truth leads to the lies
The heart aint always right
And I see that love is blind now
Boy you use to have my trust
Without no trust there aint no us boy

(Chorus)
[Verse 1 - Omarion] 
Even though you're all alone 
All I know when I am gone 
I just wanna keep you warm 
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back 

Yes, I'll be there 

Cause when I'm all alone 
I think about your face 
And how I wanna touch, 
I'm so far away (I'm Sooo) 

All I wanna do is give you all of me now 
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah 

[Chorus] 
don't go missing 
fly with me 
fly with me, fly with me 
fly with me 
check it out, check it out 
don't go missing 
fly with me, fly with me 

[Verse 2 - Drake] 
I'm aware that we just met 
I don't wanna leave you yet 
Promise that I won't forget 
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back 

Yes, I'll be there 

About to board the flight, 
Sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you 
But I'm so far away (I'm Sooo)

All I wanna do is give you all of me now 
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oooh 

[Chorus] 
don't go missing 
fly with me 
fly with me, fly with me 
fly with me 
check it out, check it out 
don't go missing 
fly with me, fly with me
"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you?
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl

But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My heart belongs to you
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then

But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My hearts belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
If anyone asks, you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I can quit when I'm ready (I can quit)
I ain't hurting nobody but me

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse, oh no
It's just a relapse

I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
I can't get no peace of mind

Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it's seeing now
Ooh darling, gahlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it's feeling now?

I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
I can't get no peace of mind

Get no piece
Get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace
(Get, g-g-get no peace oh)
<div class="lyricbox">That first cold September night
You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the years stood still
You said we don’t have to till I said I will, yeah
We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don’t want to watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside for it was too late
Oh I, oh I’m not trying
Oh I, oh I, but I can’t stop smiling, yeah

Do you think about me like I think about you

I moved on to another town
Wrote you letters till the ink ran out
When the clouds rolled in
I grabbed the keys
And played that song that we used to sing
I met a boy a lot like you
It’s funny how he used to sing it too
But he always just a little out of key
So much different than you and me
Oh I, oh I’m not even trying
Oh I, oh I, but I can’t stop smiling, yeah

Do you think about me like I think about you
Do you think about me like I think about you, oh yeah

Sometimes I wonder if you wonder
What it could have been like
When you’re sitting there drinking coffee
Are you thinking of me
When it’s thundering and raining outside
Oh I, oh I’m not even trying
Oh I, oh I but I can’t stop smiling
Oh I, oh I, it’s mystifying

Do you think about me like I think about you
Do you think about me</div>
It's not me and you
It's not me. It's you
You're reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh)

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh)

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) 
I guess that's just the motion (oooh)

Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
(I guess that's just the motion)
Talking to you's not enough (no ohh)

I guess that's just the motion (ohh)
I guess that's just the motion 
I guess that's just the motion
I'm so into you
I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do
Is to fall in deep

But close ain't close enough
'Til we cross the line
So name a game to play
And I'll roll the dice

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watching us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

This could take some time
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watching us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watching us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
<div class="lyricbox">Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call), if I got you today
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause girl I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet later on the low

Don't tell me your my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking

Girl you see me here standing here
Standing in the rain
Any chance that you could stay right here
And never go away

You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause girl I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet later on the low

Don't tell me your my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking

So what I’m really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn’t been easy for us to talk with everyone being around
But this is, this is personal, this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I know the seasons may change
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I'm under this umbrella and I’m calling your name
And you know I don’t wanna lose that

I still believe in us
I still believe in love
I hope you believe in love
The way I believe in us

You don’t see, 'cause what you don’t see, is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands I’d give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I’m feelin’
I wanna know if you feeling the way that I, the way that I

You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
Be careful with your heart</div>

This Christmas

Wrapping gifts without you babe
Starting in December and there's no call
I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay

And I don't care
If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now

And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that
All I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you
This Christmas
In the dark we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from the world outside we know
In your lips I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from our world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
Run away from the world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And you can't stop my heart
And it's my favorite part

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
No I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
'Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable

Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone (oh no)
Didn't waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
'Cause I was out of line (oh, yeah)

But I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl

It was a bad day (hey, yeah, yeah)
I know I was wrong
But you could have said "goodbye" baby
It was a bad day
Now I'm like, "wow"

It was a bad day
Oh, oh whoa
Oh whoa

Where are you now?
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand?
I wanna be close

Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

Where are you now?
Now that I'm half-grown
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone

Where are you now?
When nothing's going right?
I can't see the light

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

I need you
To need me
Can't you see me
How could you leave me
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole
When you're not with me

I want you
Here with me
To guide me
Hold me
And love me now

Where are you now?
Ohh

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be, yeah
I need you to set me free, yeah

Oh-oh
Where are you now? Oh
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh
Yeah
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

Padre Nuestro
Queestas en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
Amen
Shake up the world.
That is what I'm about to do,
And homie you ain't even on my altitude.
I'm tellin' you, I got enough cloud for two,
And like a nigga turn blood I came out the blue.
They like, "damn who's Drake, where's wheel-chair-Jimmy at?"
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that.
I'm cuttin' lights out like it's bedtime.
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine.
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in.
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgetin'.
I'm like jeopardy,
I'm still buzzin' in Every city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in.
(ugh) I miss cake these days.
I can't even afford a mistake these days.
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days.
Please don't take offense to my ways.

Cause I need drug money,
Who got drug money?
I am talkin' "white phantom sittin' on dub" money.
I am talkin' "cold champagne at the club" money.
And no I ain't emotional but baby I love money.
To all these A&amp;R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum.
I spit dirty like I'm chewin' on black gum.
I fooled y'all ain't shit for me to come back from.

[Rapping:]
How the fuck jay and dame gon' break up before they meet Drake.
I'm sure it can be resolved I'm just hopin' that they make up.
I've perfected my craft using mo zest,
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process.
Get it?
Craft. Single. Cheese. Process.
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess.
Top notch, no less.
Oh yes.
I'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model to show chest.
Cause you deal with agents from check collections.
I'm keepin' it clean in a little X direction.
And baby girl if you don't like me, it's probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection.
The city is mine, I control this.
You know this.
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this [?].
I'm a Jamaican doctor, The Bay, WHAT UP OTIS?
I'm back with the form like opus I go.

I think I suck sometimes.
But when you're in the spot light everything seems good. (Oooh Yeah) Sometimes I feel like I have it worst cuz I always have to keep my guard up.
I dont know who to trust.
I dont know who wants to date me for who i am.
Or who wants to be my friend for who I REALLY am.

Your grandpa died
When you were nine
They said he had
Lost his mind
You have learned
Way too soon
You should never trust the pantaloon

Now it's your turn
To be alone
Find a wife
And build yourself a home
You have learned
Way too soon
That your dad is now a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now, 
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
Cuz your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmare and your frights

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind
Surely there's an explanation
Ruby lips, a lost temptation
I shake my hips in celebration, baby

And there's no telling what you're gonna do
Toss me out like yesterday's news
Make it hard for me to like you, baby

And I was happy for you, this I know
I heard it on the radio
And I miss you more with every day
But really, we work well this way
So you go your way, and I'll go mine

Now someone tell me why I even care
Right it down, somewhere, I'll meet you there
Who said loving you was ever fair, baby?

Now forgive me for wanting everything candle-lit
Write me off because I gave a shit
Don't you worry, I'll get over it, baby

But I was happy for you this I know
I heard it on the radio
And I miss you more with every day
But really, we work well this way

And at least parts are always healing
Though the thought of you leaves me reeling
But at least I know I'm still feeling
At least I still know

And surely there's an explanation
Ruby lips, a lost temptation
I shake my hips in celebration, baby
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

That that should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield
This pain in my heart oh oh oh

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me, giving you flowers
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
Never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go whoa oh oh
That should be me
Never gonna let you go hey ey
I'm never gonna let you go whoa oh oh
That should be me

Daydreamer, sitting on the seat 
Soaking up the sun, he is a real lover
Making up the past
And feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
He's the subject of their talk 
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back
Oh

You can find him sitting on your doorstep 
Waiting for the surprise 
It will feel like he's been there for hours 
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt 
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be 
But he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you through 
There's no way I could describe him 
What I'll say is, just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sitting on my doorstep 
Waiting for the surprise 
He will feel like he's been there for hours 
And I can tell that he'll be there for life 
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
<div class="lyricbox">Take off all the makeup, girl
Shine your light, show the world
Don’t be shy, don’t be scared
You don’t have to hide under there
Let’s throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
When nobody ever told you
Yeah
La la la la la

Mirror mirror on the wall
Acting like he knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
He doesn’t care what’s underneath
All hung up on the negative
Doesn’t have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
When nobody ever told you

Free as a bird
Up on a watch
Just like a flower growing wild
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
When nobody ever told you

You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold

Welcome to this Christmas;
Only comes one time a year, don't miss this...
I just wanna welcome you to Christmas;
Let me sneak into your speakers, listen,
I'll be singing, "Oh..." (Oh....) Oh... (Oh...)
Hey, good girl with your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you're thinkin' about
You'll see a good boy, gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin' with your heart in the dirt

His lips are dripping honey but he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving, go and throw away the key
Hey good girl, get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind, won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find, he's no good, girl
No good for you, you better get to getting on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go, better listen to me, he's low, low, low

Hey, good girl, you got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl, like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love

But he's really good at lying, yeah, he'll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever, well, it don't mean much
Hey good girl, so good for him
Better back away honey, you don't know where he's been

Why, why you gotta be so blind, won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find, he's no good, girl
No good for you, you better get to getting on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's low, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, he's no good, girl, why can't you see
He'll take your heart and break it, listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind, won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find, he's no good, he's no good
Won't you open up your eyes, it's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl, no good for you

You better get to getting on
Your goodbye shoes

<div class="lyricbox">She’s a small town hard working woman
It’s time to make a living
Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths in a run down kitchen
When you’re never taking nothing
And doing nothing but giving
It’s hard to be a good wife
And a good mom and a good Christian

Saying I don’t drink
But sometimes I need a safe drink
Sipping for no harbor glass
Let the world fade away
Saying I don’t smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break

He’s a big city hard working man
Just trying to climb a ladder
First generation to go to college
Instead of driving a tractor
Never had nothing handed to him on a silver platter
It’s hard to be a good man, a good son
Do something good that matters

He said I don’t drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that tap
Take a swing and make the world stop
And watch it fade away
He said I don’t smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
And when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break

So here’s to you
And here’s to when the day gets long
Go ahead I understand if you wanna take a load off

I don’t drink
But sometimes I need a stiff train
Sipping for no harbor glass
Let the world fade away
I don’t smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break

When the day gets long
When the words are turning
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go away</div>

[Verse 1]
Hey there, pretty girl, you know exactly what you got, 
And I don't, blame you at all.. 
You cant resist it.. 
Especially when the lights so bright, and the money so right, 
And it's coming in every single night 
She don't wanna leave, 
She just stuck in.. 

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, 
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta..she just stuck in 
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas 
And she dance, to the song, and she dance to the song, and it go: 
"Hey now now watch her go down" 

[Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry, if she wants it she'll get it on her own 
She knows there's more to life, and she's scared of ending up alone 

[Bridge]
Throw your ones up in the air, throw your ones up in the air for her 
Throw your ones up in the air, cuz the ones you throw will get her out of...

[Verse 3]
We all got dreams and we all start reaching, 
All start peaking, all-star weekend.. 
One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping, 
Housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent 
Young girls envy the life ya'll leading, 
Never satisfied with a nice calm evening 
You be at the games looking right all season, 
But you always with me on the night ya'll leaving 
Ass low, ass low, I always request you 
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue 
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you 
I give you my all, and the next morning you'll forget 
Who, or Why, or How, or When 
Tonight is probably' about to happen all over again 
Cuz she live in a mindset that I could never move to 
Until you find yourself, its impossible to lose you 
Uh, because I never had you... 
Although I would be glad to... 
I probably go and tattoo..your name on my heart, 
I swear I start, 
To think, 
That I'm going crazy 

[Bridge]
Throw your ones up in the air, throw your ones up in the air for her 
Throw your ones up in the air, cuz the ones you throw will get her out of:

It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl, oh
And I'm not ready to call it quits

We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby, believe me

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can't go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy oh
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly (honestly) with the strength of our love
We can't go nowhere but up

It's a big big world
And I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimmin' in

We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby, believe me, ooh

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can't go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly (honestly) with the strength of our love
We can't go nowhere but up

Nowhere but up oh oh

Baby, we were underground
We're on the surface now
We're gonna make it girl
I promise
If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but up

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear yeah whoa
Baby, we can't go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy (whoa)
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, honestly with the strength of our love
We can't go nowhere but up (whoa, whoa)

Nowhere but up (whoa, whoa)
whoa whoa
Nowhere but up whoa whoa
Yeah
Nowhere but up
(Honestly)
Yeah yeah
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular (?) they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim

(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

(VERSE 2:)
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down
KyanaL
I lay alone awake at night 
Sorrow fills my eyes 
But I'm not strong enough to cry 
Despite of my disguise 
I'm left with no shoulder 
But everybody wants to lean on me 
I guess I'm their soldier 
Well, who's gonna be mine 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 

I bottle all my hurt inside 
I guess I'm living a lie 
Inside my mind each day I die 
What can bring me back to life? 
A simple word, a gesture 
Someone to say you're beautiful 
Come find this buried treasure 
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 

I've given too much of myself 
And now it's driving me crazy 
(I'm crying out for help?) 
Sometimes I wish someone would 
Just come here and save me 
Save me from myself 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 
After she saves the world
She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for
And she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
She can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this live
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Why can I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see, how good this can be
I hope she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side
Cause she gets the light that is in me
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' 'em out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh

Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
You know, you know

Uh uh yeah
You know, you...
You know, you know

Uh uh
Yeah

You know, you know
How the story go
You done jocked my style
You done stole my flow
You done seen me out
You gets no hello
And you wonder why
Man you know you know (you know, you know)
Yeah, and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02
And everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true 
Yeah, but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it, I made it
But I'm still playin' like I'm being scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch I hope you're proud of us 
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I'll be outta time 'fore I'm outta luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know, you know (you know, you know)

You know, you know (x6)
Uh, please make your long story shorter
'Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border (you know, you know)
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on a atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my acting days (you know, you know)
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So were courtside when lebron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there, I be there
You see that '62 sittin' outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin' to the top this my leap year, prepare
I'm puttin' in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' that I coulda done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin' (you know, you know)
Damn, what happened to us
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I gotta party you stare at me in disgust
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus (you know, you know)
'Specially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore
The paparazzi outside trying to record
Why has every woman never dined here before
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur (you know, you know)
The (?) the Gaia's and the (?)
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn't what your motive is (you know, you know)
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know, you know (you know, you know)

You know, you know (x3)

<div class="lyricbox">We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home
I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It's getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever
We gone forever</div>
I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
I'm gon' make this go
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone [x2]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look,
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin
Because They Swimmin In Women
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors
They Come In Secret Flavors
Thats Why I Envy Omar
Because So Far

And Thats Some Higher Learning
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot
With The Tires Burnin
And Im A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith
In Any Female Thats Askin What I Was Earnin
I Met This Recent Lady
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy
Now Im Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately
Im All Alone, I Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces
Circling Workplaces
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is
They Get To First Bases
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin
He Wanna Know What The First Trace Is
Now You Like Macgyver
Cuz You Sneakin Around
And She Dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her
I Cant Relate To That
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact

I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It
With [?] And They Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In
And In The End I Listen But I Dont See Me As They Do
Cuz Its My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls
Either Way Im All Alone, Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone

[Verse 3: Drake]
Check,
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet
But Theres Logic Behind It
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It
I Tend To Freak With This
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss
Thinkin She Been Spoiled
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days
And Come Up With Tin Foil

We Could Dissect It See
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing
Gave Her Nothing
Her Reputations In Jeopardy
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling Im Wrong
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone

Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

'Cause all of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

My doctor say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

All of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Give me your all and nothing else
Last night
I was pouring out my heart like a waterfall to you
And with one kiss
I was a runaway train flying off the track to you

"I love you" came flooding out
Couldn't make it stop, couldn't shut my mouth
Fell like a fool then I lied and said I was sorry, but

I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard

'cause you heard me right, and I won't try
To fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

You know
People say a lot of things that they don't really mean
And last night
I told a little white lie hoping you'd forget the scene

Where it felt like a movie under that porch light
Couldn't help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant that I lied and said I was sorry

I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard

'cause you heard me right, and I won't try
To fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

Oh, there's no time to be
Holding it all and trying to pretend
That I don't feel anything
Oh, I shouldn't have said I'm sorry

I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
Can't unsay what you heard

'cause you heard me right and I won't try
To fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize

'cause you heard me right, yeah
I unapologize
You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's uh, ok, you could thank me now

Uh, yeah, well alright, here I go
Uh, mahalo from the heart, this act to follow
Lately I been drinkin' like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties
to men that I know well
that way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info
I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential
I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I musta been hard to watch
What a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditatin'
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Livin' out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party, Pat-ron(?) straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
O-V-O Clique, Redwing boo gang
Yeah, we want it all

Drop down, drop-drop
Shit is real out here
Drop down, drop-drop, get it
Get it, drop down, drop-drop

Ooo, 305 to my city
I get it I get it
I get it I get it I swear that I get it
We did it we did it
We so far from finished
I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it I get it, I get it I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it I get it

They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit

Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just live after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you, dear?
Is there anyone I could call?
No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
You say you love me
Well they feel like words to me
Well this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me

I'm drifting, I'm settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well then apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're

Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cuz I'm so fed up, boy you got me messed up
If you hit me back up, don't press your luck today, today

I'm blowing you away
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, tah tah, so long
Can't you see that you're

Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

So you turned into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go and say
I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night

Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Diamonds used to be coal - look young 'cause they got soul,
And that's why they're beautiful....
And my heart used to be cold 'til your hands laid on my soul,
Baby, and that's why you're beautiful...

I'm not wondering why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

The lovers used to make love, not just to give us their piece of the beautiful...
Remember when we made love? Love... wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

Diamonds used to be coal (be coal), look young 'cause they got soul (got soul),
And my heart used to be cold (be cold), 'til your hands laid on my soul... (my soul...)
Somebody's got to stay deep in love;
That could be us...
That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...

Ooh...
Oh, I... oh, I...

That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...
What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold
Oh
She gon' love that... I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
If I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go.
Hey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great
If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown
Today, day, I want to go away, way
'Cause things are too fast now
I want to be in Slowtown

I put my socks on my feet
Just so that my soul won't fall through my toes
And I walk through my door
Just so I don't fall through the floor

I remember when my brother and other kids from neighboring houses
Would get together, I'd ride my bike and my brother would ride his
Put cards in our spokes and make our engine sound like traffic
When using Pokemon cards, please do not use the holographics

So bold and fearless in the risks we take
Laugh in the face of gravity as it's laws we'd break
On trampolines so high, we reach for the sky, but I
Do not look up anymore and I don't know why

I put my socks on my feet
Just so that my soul won't fall through my toes
And I walk through my door
Just so I don't fall through the floor

We're going too fast, fast, save us
We're going too fast, fast, save us now

We're going too fast, fast, save us
We're going too fast, fast, save us now

We're going too fast, fast, save us
We're going too fast, fast, save us now

And I walk through my door
Just so I don't fall through the floor

Hey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great
If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown
Just singing
I feel for you but when did you believe you were alone
You say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
Where light once was
Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone, denying you need someone
To exterminate your bones
Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me
Living like a ghost you walk by everyone you know
You say that you're fine but you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know
Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me
Would you let me know your plans tonight
'Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light
And I have nothing else left to say
But I will listen to you all day, yes I will
Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me

Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never dont lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth dont you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses don't lie

Emotions come and go
Almost how the wind will blow
There so little in this world to trust in

Seduce themselves with lies
Some dont realize
They call it love but its really only lustin'

So you see you and me
We're gettin close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no

Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin I dont trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses dont lie

Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never dont lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses dont lie

You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

So you see you and me
We're gettin close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no

Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me

I try to run but theres no place to hide

Oh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah, standin' ovation
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (ooh oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (ooh oh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow, uh oh oh

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
Ya better hurry up before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talkin' 'bout, "Girl I love you, you're the one."
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is on?

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (mmm)
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught (mmm)

But you put on quite a show (ooh oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (ooh oh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you
(Goes to you)
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out

How 'bout a round of applause?
A standin' ovation

But you put on quite a show (ooh oh)
Really had me going
Now it's time to go (ooh oh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

But it's over now...
Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby I'm all set
We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on, we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost I'll be good with that
Yeah we'll find a way to make the time pass
Window rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holding my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All of our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Yeah, let's just get out of this town
Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

<div class="lyricbox">Who are you
The one for whom I’d really gladly suffer
Who are you
The one I’ll always love above another
You’re my world, you’re my hope
You’re all my dreams and all my heart

Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who loves as deep as I do

Who are you
Who takes me through the flood and through the fire
Who leads me through the desert and the dry
You’re in my thoughts, you know my mind
You’re all my things, you’re all my light

Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who loves as deep as I do

You’re my savior, you’re my center
My beginning and my end
You’re the one I live for, you’re my angel
Who are you
You’re in my thoughts (in my thoughts)
You know my mind (you know my mind)
You’re all my things, you’re all my light

Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who loves as deep as I do
Who fell on me like fire
Who chained me to desire

Who are you
The one I give my life to</div>
What am I supposed to do with this heart, with this heart?
How do I take it up if the loving on is like a work of art?
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart, with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken heart and soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart, with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

It may be wrong but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

Lost in paradise
Yeah, lost in paradise
I'm calling out your name, but you're not listening
'Cause you're staring into space again
Hey, are you dreaming of a life that seems a little better?
Are you thinking that maybe you made the wrong decision?
It's the one thing I didn't want this to be
No the one thing I didn't want this to be

Honey if you wanna be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

It's tearing me apart to see you like this
With your head in your hands, only a shadow of the person I miss
You're asking how I can like this, don't even like myself
Asking how can I be here, wish I were somewhere else
It's the one thing I didn't want this to be
No the one thing I didn't want this to be

Honey if you wanna be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

When did I become the opposition?
Why do I deserve this quarantine?
When I'm fighting hard to get back to you
I'm confused by what your silence means
When you've built your home in troubled waters
When did I become the predator,
When I'm throwing you a line here, darling?
And I'm begging you to save yourself
Yeah I'm begging you to save, save, save yourself

Yeah if you wanna be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

Be free
You just gotta tell me
I'll free you from the nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
Dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
In your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside
[Drake - Verse 1] 
Money just changed everything 
I wonder how life without it would go 
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow? 
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below 
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago

Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit 
When I 'em hear talkin' 
I just don't know what to make of it 
Hate is so familiar to me 
I'm slowly embracing it

Doesn't come natural 
Bear wit' me it could take a bit 
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racin' with 
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it 
Wayne put me right here 
That's who I get the paper wit'

I hope that my success never alters our relationship 
Yeah, this life is somethin' I would die for 
October's Own, but it's lookin' like July 4 
I just wish they'd let you try it first 
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks 

[Chorus] 
Oh, today it begins 
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 
I keep having the same dream 
And I think that I just realized what it means 

[Alicia Keys] 
All I see is fireworks, 
All I see is fireworks 
Every night it's fireworks 
Every night it's fireworks

All I see is fireworks 
Taking off like fireworks 
Taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh 

[Drake - Verse 2] 
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me 
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery 
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me 
Who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily 

What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me 
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me 
And you makin' it seem that it happened that way because of me 
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious 

There was smoke in the air before now it's me clearin' it 
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though 
You never see it comin' you just get to see it go 
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first 
Now I can see it in her eyes 
Fireworks 

[Chorus] 
Oh, today it begins 
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 
I keep having the same dream 
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Drake - Verse 3] 
Everything the same but it feels different 
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen 
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin' 
It's been years, though, I just learned to deal with it

For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport 
Got my mother in a place with some better decor 
She searched the entire city I let her explore 
And now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before

How many of our parents' marriages lasted? 
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted 
I'm flyin' back home for the heritage classic 
Searchin' for that feelin', tell me where is the magic?

Let's stay together till we're ghosts 
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close 
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first 
Yhat's why I'm really goin' off, fireworks 

[Chorus]
Oh, today it begins 
I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 
I keep having the same dream 
And I think that I just realized what it means
Lala lala lala lala, oh
You know, I never felt like this before
Just feels like somethin' real

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question and you're, of course, the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you, I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock

Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making (Y-O-U) this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

SOS please somebody help me, yeah
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it (all of the time)
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me (best of me), so now I'm losing it

Lala lala lala lala, oh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala

You know it, I know it, yeah
We don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t want to be left with the questions, why
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
'Cause we’re strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we got to learn to trust right now

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That’s what we ought to do
Yeah

Yeah, sometimes the heart what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie

Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile (oh whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey

Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
Cause baby (hey)
You smile, I smile (whoa hey)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey

Make me smile baby

Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between

And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command

Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
[Nickelus F: speaking]
Niggas in the city hatin' me man they trippin'
When I'm the only one that's really spittin'
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really grippin'
Why you deck(?)me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?

Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse: Nickelus F] 
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbin on 
These rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they neega(?)
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanca from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin
That its crack we placed in your stereo system
Yea, I be at your burial trippin
Nickelus F from Richmond
VA, 
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

[Verse: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
But compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touchin my palm
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
Cause I'm harnessin a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
To play around, to perfection I'm the spittin image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spittin image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad, I say "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boi
Sitting up on the roof sneaking a smoke by the chimney
Checking out the moon and the city lights
Takes off his flannel shirt drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight (and she says)
I don't want this night to end... why does it have to end

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up
Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

A tear falls off her cheek right when it hits his arm (he says)
C 'mon baby let's get out of here
They take one last drive round town man it already looks different
He bangs the wheel says "Life Ain't Fair"
This growing up stuff man I don't know... just don't wanna let you go

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up
Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

That's what my mama told me and just like those kids I didn't
I didn't wanna listen to no one
There's nothing you can do nothing you can say I know how it feels
When love goes away 

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up
Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
But here it is, they don't have long
The night before life goes on
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

I'm a make you bend your back
Oh my God this beat is crack
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

I'm a bring the party back
We gon blow the thermostate
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
And the beat, beat, beat, beat...

Automatic, dance-natic, I can get enough
I can get enough, I can get enough, of that beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Wanna show you how much I will forever be true

Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good
Wanna show you how much, how much you're understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me bay

Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo' heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down

Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz

You'll never need two, 'cuz I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you

'Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop-poppin' this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up

And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show
Daddy you know what's up

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz
It's 'bout to go down

Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cuz you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes

While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel

Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz
It's 'bout to go down
<div class="lyricbox">I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost 
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me 
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out 
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog 
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb 
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard 
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire 
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows 
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean rosé?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man</div>
We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon... and nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing forreal
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been... Why has it been...
Who you been crying to?
Who you been flying to?
Who's bed are you sleeping in?
Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Justin Bieber
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Tyga
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than its gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
That I thought
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment

Justin Bieber
Now Romeo &amp; Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie &amp; Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do

You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't
I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam &amp; Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny &amp; Cher
I don't care
I got you baby

See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
(Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
(And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore (ooh)

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever (yeah, babe)
On the highway to hell, yeah (ooh)

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby
(Oooh)

Thought on your body I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh baby!

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX! 

R-E U-P G-A-N-G

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so (?) I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations Imma exceed it uh
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here Imma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash, a purchase (?)
You only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy! 

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall

<div class="lyricbox">[Intro]
 Yesterday when we were getting high,  you were invited
You woulda liked it
 Uh uh nah, I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye,  but you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it,  you can stay but shawty here I go

[Drake - Verse 1] 
Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
 I'm living inside the moment
Not taking pictures to save it 
I mean how could I forget 
My memories never faded

I can't relate to these haters 
My enemies never made it
 I am... still here with who I started with 
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
 I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit 
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship

 Uhh, I'm 23 with a money tree 
Growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
 It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops  and now my garden is enormous

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead,  uh ahh
That's word to the millions that they putting up
 I'm trying to do better than good enough! 

[Chorus] 
What am I afraid of 
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
 Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh , oh
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh, oh

[Drake - Verse 2]
Am I wrong for making light of my situation
 Clap on, when 40 got some shit for me to snap on 
Now that I'm on I don't want to really worry about getting back on
 I'm just trying to stay on
 Get my fucking buffet on 

I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home 
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone 
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall 
That I barely know at all and ...

Plus this women that I mess with unprotected
Text us saying she wish she woulda kept it 
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man  I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is

 I'm holding on by a thread it's like I'm high right now 
The guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now 
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now 
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of 
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
 Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh , oh
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh, oh

[Drake - Verse 3] 
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me 
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me 
Which made me question when I went missing 
And when I start treating my friends different 

Maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up 
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
But a fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
 I know, the same time I'm quick to forget 

About to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets 
Burn it all burn it all, I'm starting it fresh 
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed 

Did I just trade free time for camera time 
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer time
Yeah, I just need some closure, ain't no turning back for me
 I'm in it till it's over</div>

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway, if it was our way
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

(They be alive tomorrow?)
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists
And no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary
Forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry

All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?


They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Mafia

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live (then we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears?
So far away and now I just need you here

So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live (and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road (there's no road)
To get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle 
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
Whatcha gonna do with the 36 cents
Sticky with Coke on your floorboard?
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk vent trying to keep warm
Do you call her over, hand her the change?
Ask her her story, ask her her name
Or do you tell yourself

You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world

Oh, whatcha gonna do when you're watching TV
And an ad comes on, yeah, you know the kind
Flashing up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day you could save a life
Do you call the number, reach out a hand?
Or do you change the channel, call it a scam
Or do you tell yourself

You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world
Don't listen to 'em when they say
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world

The world's so big it can break your heart
And you just wanna help, not sure where to start
So you close your eyes, and send up a prayer into the dark

You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world
Don't listen to 'em when they say
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't you listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world

(It's your chance, take her hand to the floor)
Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)
Ladies, I know you're ready

Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance
(So take advantage of the slow jam)
Tell 'em JB

Justin Bieber
When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Usher
It's your chance, take her hand
To the floor, to the floor
Girl if you see some and you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance
For your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man

Justin Bieber
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?

There must be something in the water
'Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me

Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I bleed
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me

You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and dark of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Girls! We run this mutha... yeah!
Girls! We run this mutha... (Girls.)

Who run the world? Girls. (Girls!)

Who run this mutha? Girls!

Some of them men think they freak this like we do, but no they don't;

Boy, I'm just playin' - Come here, baby;
Hope you still like me - Eff you, pay me...

My persuasion can build a nation;
Endless power - With our love, we can devour...
You'll do anything for me...
Who run the world? Girls.

Who run the world? Girls. (Girls!)

Who run this mutha? Girls!

Who run the world? Girls! (Girls!)

It's hot up in here - DJ don't be scared to run this, run this back;
I'm reppin' for the girls who taking over the world, help me raise a glass for the college grads...
41 Rollie to let you know what time it is, check;
You can't hold me! (You can't hold me.) I work my 9 to 5, better cut my check...

This goes out to all the women getting it in - you on your grind;
To all the men that respect what I do, please accept my shine...

Strong enough to bear the children, then get back to business...

Hope you still like me - Eff you, pay me...

Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
I'm a kitchen sink, you don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me, ok friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something then, it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

Go away
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you, and neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's all right

Zack:
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
better I am, Gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away
Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
<div class="lyricbox">I be on the hotline like errday,  makin’ sure the DJ know what I want him to play;
You know I got my top back and my beat low, rockin’ my stunna shades and turnin’ up my radio...
Turn up my radio...

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room;
With the door closed, we'd be alone...
And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom,
'Cause she knew we were in the zone...

Hold him in my arms, and look out of my window (under the moonlight),
And he'd be keeping me calm, so I never let him go;
He's got a place in my heart...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;

When I get into my car, I turn it uh-uh, uh-up,
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-uh, uh-unk,
And the bassline be rattling through my se-ee, ee-ats,
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing, ee-ing, oh...
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays;
He’s got a place in my heart...

I think I’m in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound....

And rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;

Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Rocket/rock it 'til waterfalls/water falls....
Rocket 'til waterfalls...
Rock it 'til water falls...
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession - I gotta make a confession:
I'm proud of all this bass - baby, I'll put it in your face...
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist,
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer;
Anything else that you may read between the lines, you and I create...
Rockets and waterfalls...

So rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;

Growing inside me - Life has a reason...
Swimming in my love, your love lifting,
Higher, harder, got me screaming to the lord, boy...
Kiss me - Pray we don't overflow, baby, I know you can feel it pulse,
Deep in the peak of my waterfall...
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, 'til the water falls... (Rockets and waterfalls...)

Damn.
I can't help but love the way we make love...
Daddy... Daddy... ooh, child. Ooh, now. 
Yes, Lord. Damn, baby.... You're driving me cray-cray...

You ain't right for doing it to me like that, Daddy,
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl...
Tell me, what you're gon' do about that?
(Punish me, please... Punish me, please...)

Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right... I know I'm right;
Hell yeah, you the shit - that's why you're my equivalent...

Consumers... (What about that ching-ching-ching? What about that, what about that ching-ching?)
Baby boomers... (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in...
Home is where the heart is;

In love 
And no one could ever talk bout you 
But it sucks, so many and alabies 
I love mmmm 

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 

So in love 
I just didn't see the wrong you did 
In love 
But now that I know I can admit 
It was the love that made me a fool silly fool 
In love uh, crazy feelings 

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 

It was always in my face, all the time 
Even wit 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie 

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 
Make me stay in love wit you (repeat until end)

Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees

Right now, 'ow
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all

So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know
You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces

Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough

I will try when he's gone
And I wont reminice 
About the kisses I'll miss
I'll move on

I don't like 
What you are
Cause you tell me I'm wrong
When I'm just being strong
It's so far

And I was everything back then
I wasn't sure how this should end

Now I won't 
Fall apart
I'll just wither away
Cause I know that he'll stay 
In my heart

Now I know who was wrong
But I almost forgot all the things that I'm not
Though this took so very long

((chorus))
And I was everything back then
I wasn't sure how this should end
And I'll say no more

And I speak what is true
There were pleasantries spoken
Many promises broken
Attentions they grew

And now I've had my fill
And I'll dance on the street
Just to prove that I'm great
I feel ill

((chorus))
<div class="lyricbox">Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched your taillights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame
And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away

And you should know
Please, believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long
It's never easy
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say?

How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say

And you should know
Please, believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long
It's never easy
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? （What can I say?）
What can I say? (What can I say?)

I hate to think all you had of me (And I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you
Spaced between what was meant to be (In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into

And you should know
Please, believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
It's been so long
It's never easy
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say? 
What can I say? (What can I say?)</div>
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Feels like true paradise to me

Baby boy you stay on my mind

Oh you fancy huh

You getting ready so I know we gon' be here a while
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles

Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest

Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways

Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Oh you fancy huh

You you fancy huh

Well aren’t you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes dicks until some millions appear

Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I’m buying, you declining, I think that's kinda bizarre

Independent with the demeanor of an R&amp;B singer
Naked ring finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy

Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&amp;G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe
Ya don’t need it greedy or easy as these other Breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling or bowls of baked ziti

Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at the bitches hating on you with their friends

And ain't nobody realer, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Showtime
As we proceed.

Uh, five and a half of 'em boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to

Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever

You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley

How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners

The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

I’m like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Boy you broke my heart and now I’m standing here
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now I look at all these photographs

All I’ve got, all I’ve got
All I’ve got are these photographs
All I’ve got is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
You, you

Now baby it’s killing me
I’m saying it’s killing me
The fact that you went around
Baby I’m falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
And baby I’m hurting now
I know you’re a better man
(When I was your girl)
This land is a better land
(When you’re in my world)
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely...

All I’ve got, all I’ve got
All I’ve got are these photographs
All I’ve got is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you

All I’ve got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don’t wanna be stuck in the past
But you’re all that I have that I had
And I don’t wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you’re my superstar
I’d give anything, baby here’s my heart
My heart, my heart…

(Will.i.am)
My heart don’t stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it’s over
Girl I’ve been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma’s sofa
Girl I got this lovey dovey in my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin… Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
I am not the one
Why couldn’t you be the one?

All I’ve got, all I’ve got
Is nothing without you
You, you,
You, you
All I've got, is nothing without...

All I've got are these photographs...
All I’ve got are these photographs</div>
Yeah
J-J-J JB
Yeah, whoa
No, no

Now I can see it girl
You ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me
Like they wanna do something
I feel the chemistry
Yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility

Seen you a couple times
Had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind
Had a couple observations
Like you're a fly chick
You could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

Just keep it quiet, keep it on my hush
And what we do keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me?
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl
Telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ
All in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl
If you wanna ride with me
And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off, no problem
You can go your way, and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Just keep it quiet, keep it on my hush
And what we do keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me?
Then tell everybody? oh no
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh

Don't tell your homies
Don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends
That'll start some drama
Stay off that facebook
I'll treat you real good
You keep this private
And you can get what I give

Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody (everybody)
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me?
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, whoa
Whoa oh
I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell
No, no, no
That's not me
I can see it in your eyes: you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it: Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon hear this: I'm the man
Yeah I said it! Bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up: did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in your ear: that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Hook]
Take a shot for me, ooooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me

[Rick Ross - Verse 2]
Ok look: I'm honest
Girl I can't lie: I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it..

[Hook]
May your neighbours respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you

[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]

[Drake - Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
With the people that I won’t forget
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
For the things that I won’t regret

I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
Tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
That’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now

This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
Go to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
If you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now

[Drake - Verse 2]
How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money, Young Money, pop champagne

Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
And start livin’ that life dawg

Feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature
Ahh, young and rich and out of control

Out in L.A. blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
So imma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
Call me overrated or creative or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup</div>

<div class="lyricbox">If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah.
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh.

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would
I would build the love of river wide,
So that it never runs dry, yeah
Anytime you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry⬧
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind, no.

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.
If I could make a better way,
So you could see a better day,
Baby, I would, baby, I would.

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I would
Yeah, it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need.
I know that he hurt you,
But that wasn't me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That all we need to be

If I could take away the pain
And put a smile on your face,
Baby, I would, baby, I would
If I could make a better way,

<div class="lyricbox">I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink
In this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Beyoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you'll been hanging out alright tonight
I'm staying out till tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables
Ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this no, no, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
Oh I'm jealous</div>
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Woah, what now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why

So what now?

If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I’d jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Looking in the mirror I’m embarrassed
I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died</div>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

<div class="lyricbox">[Intro]
 Yesterday when we were getting high,  you were invited
You woulda liked it
 Uh uh nah, I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye,  but you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it,  you can stay but shawty here I go

[Drake - Verse 1] 
Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
 I'm living inside the moment
Not taking pictures to save it 
I mean how could I forget 
My memories never faded

I can't relate to these haters 
My enemies never made it
 I am... still here with who I started with 
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
 I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit 
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship

 Uhh, I'm 23 with a money tree 
Growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
 It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops  and now my garden is enormous

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead,  uh ahh
That's word to the millions that they putting up
 I'm trying to do better than good enough! 

[Chorus] 
What am I afraid of 
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
 Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh , oh
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh, oh

[Drake - Verse 2]
Am I wrong for making light of my situation
 Clap on, when 40 got some shit for me to snap on 
Now that I'm on I don't want to really worry about getting back on
 I'm just trying to stay on
 Get my fucking buffet on 

I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home 
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone 
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall 
That I barely know at all and ...

Plus this women that I mess with unprotected
Text us saying she wish she woulda kept it 
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man  I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is

 I'm holding on by a thread it's like I'm high right now 
The guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now 
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now 
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of 
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
The people I don't have the time to hang with
 Always look at me and say the same shit
(They say)
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh , oh
You promised me you would never change  oh, huh huh  oh, huh huh, oh

[Drake - Verse 3] 
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me 
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me 
Which made me question when I went missing 
And when I start treating my friends different 

Maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up 
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
But a fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
 I know, the same time I'm quick to forget 

About to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets 
Burn it all burn it all, I'm starting it fresh 
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed 

Did I just trade free time for camera time 
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer time
Yeah, I just need some closure, ain't no turning back for me
 I'm in it till it's over</div>
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you, and boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it (rumour)


She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it (rumour)


All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it (rumour)



But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for
I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floating in and out on consciousness

And they say that I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?

I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cuz I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't wanna problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that 

No, don't do it, please don't do it
'Cuz one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money
So Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know 
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know

Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide 
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know, yeah

I be yelling out 
Money over everything
Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake, girl don't tempt me

If they don't get it they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you're supposed to do
I'm like "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's... true.

Listen to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's how you thinking is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cuz I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it I don't even gotta say it
They know

They know, they know, they know 
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know

Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide,
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yelling out
Money over everything
Money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell 'em I apologize, it happened over time (time, time, time)

Picture us dancin' real close
In a dark, dark corner of a basement party
Every time I close my eyes
It's like everyone left but you and me

In our own little world
The music is the sun
The dance floor becomes the sea
Feels like true paradise to me

Baby boy you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time

Baby boy not a day goes by

Ooh baby
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want

<div class="lyricbox">Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out, make you think it’s real
Funny how love can make you feel, yeah

Ouh, ouh, yeah
I just can’t leave love alone
Hey!

Ain’t it funny how love can make you fly
Sweetest buzz and the highest high
When you can’t walk to the other side
Ain’t it funny how love can make you fly

Ouh, I can’t stop it
Ouh, gotta have it, want it,
I can’t help it
I just can’t leave love alone

Oh come on!
Burn me once but it don’t sink in

Go ahead, go ahead and
Smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left
And take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact it's been a wasted worried year

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
'Cause there's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream, and
Shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah, See if I care
See if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind
And on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong

And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Baby, take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There are many ways to act
And you cannot take it back (many shades)
Oh, you cannot take it back (of black)
'Cause, there's many shades of black (many shades)
You have many shades of black (of black)
You have many, You have many (shades of black)

Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' New To Say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin left
It's when I'm goin right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And Show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me

Catch me now before I fall

I don't know what happened

Where did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me? or did I lose control?

Lonely overseas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a world baby
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It's been difficult
I’m just happy there's no fights no more
But it’s nights like this that I never ever missed you more

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security

Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him..
To think that I was wrong;
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone...
Pain is just a consequence of love;
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us...

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling,
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure...
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...

You weren't my everything til we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

You are, you are, you are...
You are, you are, you are... my everything...
Girl, do whatever you like it's your bar
Oh girl, tonight it's on me
Baby tell me what you want

[Rap - Rich Boy]
Me in the zone, gon' a patron
In a club, in a club, playin her song
That's when I slowy approach
She like daddy what you know.
Told the girl (on my drink)
Then she drop it down low

To the floor, to the floor
She took it to the floor
(repeat 3x)

[Drake]
Ok, Ok, Sittin' in a owners box
Or in the Caribbean twitin' off Corona tops
I'm sittin' down hittin' half court flowter shot

B*tches takin' pictres because every night's a photo op.
Yeah, and nothing has been photoshopped
I say I'mma buy the bar and they say n*gga no you're not
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin' other people rich is something I enjoy alot
Uh, can you tell even when your girl won't
I'mma still be feelin' me even when the world don't
Sh*t just changed forever first I get alot of dough
Then I end up with your woman that's just how it's gotta go
Yeah, and i can tell her things and treat her right
You can get whatever baby remember you and me tonight
Throw the p*ssy at me guarentee that you won't see a strike
I'mma hit it hard you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife
Uh, tell me, how does that sound?
I can get it ass up and with your back down
Spit that all suki suki in your ear
It's the n*gga Rich Boy and the rookie of the year
Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain
I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me
In anticipation
For precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day

Rain man is back
With little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come in to me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

Work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Join me, I deserved it
No time to have you lurking
If I got right then you might like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nobody touch me, I'm the righteous
Nobody text me in a crisis

I believed all of your dreams are fruition
You took my heart and my keys and my vision
You took my heart off my sleeve, a decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been

But I wake up and everything's wrong
Just get ready for work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be

You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Before the tables turned, turned, turned, turned

Begging, something please
Baby, don't you leave
Don't leave me stuck here in the streets (no, no)

If I get another chance to
I will never, no never neglect you
I mean, who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this true
What can I say?
Please recognize I'm trying baby

I been work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
I work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done
That'll work, come over
We just need that slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one

Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over

Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me
Oh yeah, I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
How many more shots until you're rolling?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the

Work, work, work, work, work, work
You see me I be
You see me, do me
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
For some of that
Work, work, work, work, work, work
For you I got
Love, love, love, love, love, love
When I came for my
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

Work, work, work
Baby you're a wrecking ball
Crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall
Piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I'd never need you, baby

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong

Everybody's telling me
I'm over my head
If they don't feel you loving me
They all say that I've gone crazy
Maybe, but it's too late now to save
I'm too tangled

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Maybe it's not right
But that's all right
Yeah, it's all right tonight

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Even it's just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit twisted
Yeah
It's twisted
[LUPE FIASCO: TALKING]
Uh, what up y'all!
Soundtrack what's popping baby?
Y'all ain't know, I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea, uh!
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying?
Legally and illegally
Hahaha...
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out

[VERSE 1: LUPE FIASCO]
First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yea, when they said, "It's getting late in here..
...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

[CHORUS]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

[VERSE 2: DRAKE]
(Waddup Lupe, Chi Town!)
My style is very Tennessee 
Mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barley remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
But check it gets boring growing up in memphis
Trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
Luckly my aunt working as a nurse
So every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
And plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
If i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work
I tell her i was there on vacation
She say you need to be doing something other than skating
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
I ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
So now its me and old school
Chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
He knew i didn't really wanna post here
Open up the window told me that the coast clear
Now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
Life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes i'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
Kick flip in the air
The kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here
Breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
I say aunty this is a safe career
She said Drake i told you there's no skating here

[CHORUS:]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

[VERSE 3: LUPE FIASCO]
Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"

[CHORUS:]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled up that gun

Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum
Man down

Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd

Oh I, I
Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

It's a 22
I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What do you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my firearm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum
Man down

Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd

Oh I, I
Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

Look I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh

What ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger

Pull the trigger pull the trigger boom
And end a nigga end a nigga life so soon
When me pull the trigger pull the trigger pull it on you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna what I'm gonna do

Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bum
Me say one man down oh me say
Rum bum bum bum rum bum bum bumm rum bum bum bum
And me ran downtown

'Cause now I am criminal criminal criminal
Oh Lord oh mercy now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please give me minimal
Run out of town on the grand seminal seminal

Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd

Oh why oh why
Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfections
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
and that's exactly what I mean.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
I wanna know
Oh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh baby, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
I won't let the night stand in my way
I know what I want, I know what I can
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next you

Cause I all I need is one love
Baby give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need tonight

See i've made mistakes time after time, time, time
But no not today, won't leave till I find what i'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is dance under the moon

Cause I all I need is one love
Baby give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need tonight

Your love is like a rollercoaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like i'm slowly falling deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper

Cause I all I need is one love
Baby give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
Baby no no nobody, can give it to me
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need

I don't fall slow like I used to
I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound

My parachutes will get me
Safely to ground
But now the cord's not working
And I see you staring me down

I won't fall in
Love with fall in
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

I think you would beat 
The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be
The very first thing that I missed

I was doing fine on my own
And there wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher
And I don't know if I want it back

I won't fall in
Love with fall in
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

'Cause I'm not sure 
I want to give you
Tools that can destroy
My heart

And judges don't say
What you want to hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe
In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly

I won't fall in
Love with fall in
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

But now I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Oooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning, ohh...
She was lost in so many different ways 
Out in the darkness with no guide 
I know the cost of a losing hand 
There but for the grace of God go I 

I found heaven on earth 
You were my last, my first 
And then I hear this voice inside 
Ave Maria 

I've been alone 
When I'm surrounded by friends 
How could the silence be so loud 
But I still go home knowing that I've got you 
There's only us when the lights go down 

You are my heaven on earth 
You are my hunger, my thirst 
I always hear this voice inside 
Singing Ave Maria 

Sometimes love can come and pass you by 
While your busy making plans 
Suddenly hit you and then you realize 
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand 

You are my heaven on earth 
You are my last, my first 
And then I hear this voice inside 
Ave Maria 
Ave Maria
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

River Lea, River Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea

(verse 1) 
What's up? 
I know we haven't spoken for a while 
But I was thinkin' 'bout you 
And it kinda made me smile 
So many things to say 
And I'll put 'em in a letter 
And it might be easier 
The words might come out better 
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
Does he still look just like you? 
So many things I wanna know the answers to 
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line 
To the story of me and you 

(chorus) 
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose 
Hope to hear from you soon 
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you 

(verse 2) 
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on 
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone 
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me 
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me 
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the T.V. 
Boy it ain't easy 
When I hear our song 
I get that same old feeling 
Wish I could press rewind 
Turn back the hands of time 
And I shouldn't be telling you

(chorus) 
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose 
Hope to hear from you soon 
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you 

Did you know I kept all of your pictures 
Don't have the strength to part with them yet 
Oh no 
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste 
But some things a girl can never forget 

(chorus) 
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried 
To get you out my mind 
But it don't get no better 
As each day goes by 
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose 
Hope to hear from you soon 
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Now that I have captured your attention
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. T say I'm ready for inspection
Show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
No stop until the morning
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah
Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
No stop until the morning
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Super power
A subtle power
A tough love
Like a shark
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power

Super power
A subtle power
A tough love
Like a shark
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Sell me candy like the summer when it's melting in my hand
I know you're around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling whisper something in my ear
Say it like sugar tell me what I wanna hear

I'm weak by your touch when it's meltin' on my lips
A rush through my body, feel it in my finger tips
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good, spoil me rotten to the core
Come on

(Chorus:)
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak
Baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
I'm the daddy! You the boss!

Be a professional, boy you make a sale
Try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta enjoy
You're running through my garden now you're knocking at my door
Forbidden little kiss and you call it bittersweet
The shorty that u rocking wit ain't nothing like me 
You're selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
Sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core
You know

(Chorus:)
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak
Baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
I'm the daddy! You the boss!

I want you babe
More than you know
So don't you leave and don't you go
I want it all, until time falls
These arms, won't hold you wrong
I want your love, give you my trust
I wanna live for both of us
I wanna breathe ya, lay on shoulder
I wanna warm ya, when nights get colder

I want love, love, love
love love..

(Chorus:)
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak
Baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
I'm the daddy! You the boss!
I would be my life like I bet my heart
That you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
You're driving my heart crazy

I can't hold out
I can't hold back now
Like I've done before

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me

How do you do that, babe?
Make me feel like I'm the only girl alive for you
I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this
First time in your arms I knew

The way you held me
I knew that this could be
What I've been waiting to find

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm gettin' in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me
(1st verse)
Looking back it's hard for me to see, 
Just how I could've been so blind,
Like an actor on the movie screen,
To play the part with every line.

But every story doesn't have a happy ending,
Sometimes the flower doesn't grow,
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending,
Boy I'm thinking you need to know

(chorus)
You could've been the one,
That I would give it all to, catch you when you fall too
Should've been the one,
Didn't know just what you had boy, now it's just too bad boy,
After all is said and done,
You're a cheater and a liar, went to play with fire,
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun, 
'cause you could've been the one.

There's nothing left to say
You could've been the one (could've been, could've been, baby)

(2nd verse)
My momma didn't raise no fool,
She said "you play with fire, you get burned",
You laughed at me, I laughed at you (hehehe),
Now it seems the table's turned.

I must admit I really thought you had potenial
But I cannot have been more wrong
I need somebody that can trust that's essential
You had your chance but now I'm gone

(chorus)
You could've been the one (could've been the one),
That I would give it all to, catch you when you fall too
Should've been the one (should've been the one baby),
Didn't know just what you had boy, now it's just too bad boy,
After all is said and done,
You're a cheater and a liar, went to play with fire,
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun, 
'cause you could've been the one.

Could've been the one baby,
You could've been the one, 

(...)
You played yourself boy and there is no denying,
... it's just the way the story goes,
You made your bed boy, you better go and lie in it,
.... you'll be lying there alone.

You could've been the one
(chorus)
You could've been the one (could've good boy),
That I would give it all to, catch you when you fall too
Should've been the one (should've been the one ),
Didn't know just what you had boy, now it's just too bad boy,
After all is said and done (after all is said and done),
You're a cheater and a liar, went to play with fire,
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun, 
'cause you could've been the one.

The Band Perry
Looking out the window
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight

Justin Bieber
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
The Band Perry
You should be here with me safe and warm

The Band Perry and Justin Bieber
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Justin Bieber
Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
Except for the clock on the wall yeah yeah

The Band Perry and Justin Bieber
I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home

When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I
Till Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
Oh oh oh oh
I'll be waiting

Waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight
Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity,
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty,
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety,
Don't know what's inside of me.

Don't forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I'm no good without you.

Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping,
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping,
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no,
You are all that I've got, no.

Don't forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I'm no good without you.

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system,
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted,
I want the markings made on my skin,
To mean something to me again,
I hope you haven't left without me, please.

Don't forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I'm no good without you, no no no no

Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no

I'll love you 'til I die, boy, every day of my life;
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you, not just on Christmas...
Wanna show you in so many ways, three-hundred-sixty-five days;
I'll give you all my presents, boy, I'm for you, not just on Christmas...

Baby, whether rain or shine, naughty or nice, I'm by your side...
I'll love you 'til I die, boy, every day of my life;
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you, not just on Christmas...

Baby, whether rain or shine, naughty or nice, I'm by your side...
Wise men say
"Only fools rush in"
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be, oh

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

But I can't help
Falling in love with you
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love

But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it?

Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding in my life
Thought I was happy on my own 
'Til you came and proved me wrong

I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see, I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole, something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah

Never pictured myself singing lullabies 
Sitting in a rocking chair in the middle of the night, in the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise

And now I'm holding what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see, I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole, something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh with your love

Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah

I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see, I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole, something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah

I never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies

We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober
I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I've become my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh
Revival

I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shattered through me like a rifle was a revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh
Revival

This won't take too long, you'll see
I'm just tryna get to me, ooh
What shattered through me like a rifle was a revival

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh
Revival

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is my revival
This is a revival

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

From 8 until late, I think 'bout you
You're all my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

I gotta pull up on you
You gon make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me I'm a go thriller on you
I'm a just,

I miss feeling on you, I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
Been about you and I'm still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they are your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back but that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you're done with that
And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

All I'm really asking for is you
Yeah

Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some
sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials...
I give you everything you want
everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care Looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune Ooh.....

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain....... DUMB
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You run and you try, and you're tryin' to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free

He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery

He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away

Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery

He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

Run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery

He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life
That's How You Like It, huh
That's How I Like It, baby

I need a thug that'll have my back
Do-rag, Nike Airs to match
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
That's how I like it, baby
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Timberland boots, you does that, it's a fact
That's how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain't
I like your honesty, integrity,
It levels me, so please don't ever change

That's How You Like It, huh
That's How I Like It, baby

I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
It's just the real things you do
That's why I wanna stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love that
Sexy way they does that (you did that)
That's how I like it, baby

I hope you like my style
The way I dress
The way I flirt
Say yes
I hope you like my mind
The things I say
If I'm with you, then I'm with only you
My loyalty will never, ever change

That's How You Like It, huh
That's How I Like It, baby

I know you've heard I'm a gangsta
They say "Stay away from them gangstaz"
They never change up, or pull they pants up,
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos &amp; the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hovah &amp; the Letter B
How you like that, huh?

That's How You Like It, huh
That's How I Like It, baby
Blue eyes, I think of you, it's easy
Somehow I just thought that you'd complete me
Days will come and days will go without you
Never know just what it is I'm going to do

Look at me, I'm on the street 
And I'm dancing, oh-whoa-oh
Look behind your sunglasses
Your eyes sing

See you with your arms wrapped 'round another
Makes me wonder why I even bother

Look at me, I'm on the street 
And I'm dancing, oh-whoa-oh
Look behind your sunglasses
Your eyes sing

Don't you know you're what I live for, what I die for?
Heartbreak running through my veins just makes me want more
Can't you see my tears fall when you walk out the door?
Don't you know you're what I live for, what I die for?

Too late to just let you go, I'm stuck here
Waiting for a word from you that sounds sincere
Standing on a mountain top, I'm falling
Starry nights, they move me when you're calling

Look at me, I'm on the street 
And I'm dancing, oh-whoa-oh
Look behind your sunglasses
Your eyes sing
(X2)
Don't you know you're what I live for, what I die for?
Heartbreak running through my veins just makes me want more
Can't you see my tears fall when you walk out the door?
Darling, you are what I live for, what I die for
<div class="lyricbox">I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me
Of who I killed
Inside my dream
I hate this car
That I'm driving
There's no hiding for me

I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence</div>
<div class="lyricbox">Te amo, te amo she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes
It's over

Then she said, te amo then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I not gonna run away
But let me go...

My soul hears her cry, without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody tell me what she say
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you

Te amo, te amo she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand I got no choice
Pulled me out on the beach danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why?
It’s over...

Then she said, te amo then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I not gonna run away
But let me go...

My soul hears her cry, without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody tell me what she say
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you

Listen we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night,
I'll move under the light

Because I understand
That we all need love
And I’m not afraid
I feel the love but I don't feel that way

Then she said, te amo then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I not gonna run away
But let me go...

My soul hears her cry, without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody tell me what she say
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you

Te amo, te amo
Don’t it mean I love you</div>
Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

Oh no
Oh no, oh (oh)

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug (last hug, last hug)
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality (reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand
And I understand that it's meant to be
'Cause baby when you're with me

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin', no pain, no fear (no fear, no fear)
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here? (are here, are here)
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor (this floor, this floor)
Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation
By taking a chance and more, oh no, because

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Take my hand (take my hand)
Let's just dance (let's just dance)
Watch my feet (watch my feet)
Follow me (follow me)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Girl I'm here (girl I'm here)
If you didn't know (if you didn't know)
This is love

Let the music blast
We gonna do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all (oh, baby)
'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

So don't fear
Don't you worry about a thing
I am here, right here (I'll never let you go)

Don't shed a tear
Whenever you need me
I'll be here (I'll never let you go)

Oh no, oh no, oh oh
I'll never let you go
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
This pain is my heart (oh oh oh)

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me, giving you flowers
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
oh-oh-oh-ohh
That should be me
Never should've let you go hey ey
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
Yeah
Whoa
Gunfire left a hole
In the tank
Losing gasoline

Fire is on my trail
And he's after me
Hope it don't get here
Before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breath

You could've been a apart of a
Masterpiece
Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going
I don't need my breaks
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb

Scenes go
But baby no
Doesn't have to be
Microwaving a medal tragedy
Watching it burn and
It's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful
When it's through
It's the other half of me

I didn't do it
You lit the match for me
Now were flying
From the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where were going
We don't need no breaks
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb

Baby we were killing them
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing
And

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire
So I wont have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where
I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
<div class="lyricbox">Beyoncé
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor gets into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints with my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7 Eleven
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic till my voice hoarse

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love

Jay-Z
Hold up
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house time back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, wanna see all that shit I heard

Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight

Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"

I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights, you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

Beyoncé
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

I've been drinking watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now)
Can't keep ya eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love</div>

I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath

Join me, I deserved it
No time to have you lurking
If I got right then you might like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nobody touch me, I'm the righteous
Nobody text me in a crisis

I believed all of your dreams are fruition
You took my heart and my keys and my vision
You took my heart off my sleeve, a decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been

But I wake up and everything's wrong
Just get ready for work, work, work, work, work, work

Don't give that away to no one

Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over

Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me
Oh yeah, I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
How many more shots until you're rolling?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the

Who else really try'na fuck with Hollywood Cole?
I'm with Marley G, bro
Flyin' Hollygrove chick to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you problly should know
This that slumdog millionare Bollywood flow
And uh, my real friends never hearin from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path
But got on different shoes
Live in the same building
But we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single
I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a poll
Plus I been sippin' so this shit is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Chorus]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you right on top
And only heaven's right above it
We onnn
It's Young Money mothafucka
If you ain't runnin' with run from it mothafucka, all right
Now somebody shove some money in this bitch
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back because I shoot first

[Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck X Games
Guns turn you boys into pussy sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my game like Jesse James
Women all possessive and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin plane
Skinny pants and some vans
Call me Triple A get my advance in advance
Amen as the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach 
I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa
But don't push me

[Chorus]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you right on top
And only heaven's right above it
We onnn
It's Young Money mothafucka
If you ain't runnin' with run from it mothafucka, all right
Now somebody shove some money in this bitch
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said
Beautiful black woman
I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg
Mothafuckin birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense
Check the paw prints
We in the building
You niggas in apartments
N-now c'mon be my blood donor
Flow so nice she ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled that?
From where they make gumbo at?
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
You know me I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip hop I'm the heart of that
Nigga nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Chorus]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you right on top
And only heaven's right above it
We onnn
It's Young Money mothafucka
If you ain't runnin' with run from it mothafucka, all right
Now somebody shove some money in this bitch
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back because I shoot first
[End]
You said "I come in peace", so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend, please listen to me

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Uh, greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world, I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taken over this planet since I've arrived
I'm in the backpack, I'm ducking Men In Black
Yeah I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gon' name this planet after me
Wayne's world (wayne's world, wayne's world)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted, it's a gift from the mother
In, in your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
<div class="lyricbox">[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement and I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father -- my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son -- man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Hook]
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked from me to you, got from me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it

[Hook]
[Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help
In keeping me in this, in this comfortably
All I can say Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feelings about that
So God bless you, and I hope i'll see you...</div>
[Verse 1:]
Uh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

[Talking:]
You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me.

[Verse 2:]
Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention and fore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why ya girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...

[Talking:]
Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

I kiss you when you lick your lips, I kiss you when you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a trip, I know you never waste a trip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

Can you lick my skittles
That's the sweetest in the middle
Pink that's the flavor
Solve the riddle
I'll lean back on my wrist something major
Make sure you clean max
That's the only way to get the
Flavor

When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up 'til I'm empty babe
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, fill it up to the top

Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

Can you lick my skittles
That's the sweetest in the middle
Pink that's the flavor
Solve the riddle
I'll lean back on my wrist something major
Make sure you clean max
That's the only way to get the
Flavor

I'm about to get into this girls
This is for all the grown women out there

I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

Ooh I've had a naughty thought today baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don't slip off when it drip off on top of ya right
Let me see in here, flippin' off and toss the bed
I know everything you want
I'mma show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bringing work up on top of me
I'mma let let you be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

Je ne sais quoi
Cheri, Leo
I swear you I, alcohol

Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

Can you lick my skittle, that's the sweetest in the middle
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle
Oh...
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I've found
Or see it from this way round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Goin' with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person, (But you'll make the same old mistakes)
Well I don't care I'm in love, (Stop before it's too late)
I finally know what it's like, (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late, I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fakes what I like
The point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
Thinking it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person, (But you'll make the same old mistakes)
Well I don't care I'm in love, (Stop before it's too late)
So how do I know if it's right? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)

Man I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story
Ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons
And she's got her regrets
Man I know that it's hard to digest
A realisation, is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons
And she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking of the only option)
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like. (Stop thinking of the only option)
In a new direction

So how will I know if it's right?
(Stop thinking of the only option)
You see my baby over here
Hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
What you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

See my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I (oh I) I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah)

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh baby
Own it
It's yours

Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is?
It's yours

Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love
Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be with you
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend
Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
It's yours

Own it, own it, own it, own it
I said go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, go own that shit
Go own that shit

Own it, own it, own it, own it
I said go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, go own that shit
Go own that shit

Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline
You should call it
When the last time you did something for the first time?
You have done it all, swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours

Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
It's yours, yeah
It's yours, own it
Own It
Baby, own it
It's yours
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit
Oh oh
Oh ohhh

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight
Through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears? Oh whoa
So far away and now I just need you here

So we'll fight
Through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh

We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
To get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

<div class="lyricbox">Desperado
Sitting in a old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Uh huh, take it easy
I’m not tryna go against you
Actually, I’m going with you

Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you won't, cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know, no, just want out of here
Yeah, once we're gone, ain’t no going back

If you want, take a peek and run away
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone

Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broken
Take it easy
I'm not trying to go against you
I can be a lone wolf fishing

Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you won't, cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know, no, both flying out of here
Yeah, once we're gone, ain’t no going back

If you want, we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
I don’t wanna be alone

Dear desperado
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone

No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
Well every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
Well every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way
Eighteen years had come and gone 
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loadin' up that Chevy

Both tryin' not to cry
Mama kept on talkin' puttin' off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
Baby don't forget

Before you hit the highway you better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray in case you run short on cash
Here's a map and here's a Bible if you ever lose your way
Just one more thing before you leave
Don't forget to remember me

This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep tellin' me I'm on my own
Just like every Sunday I called mama up last night
And even when it's not I tell her everything's all right
Before we hung up I said 
Hey mama don't forget

To tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall
Tell mee-maw that I miss her yeah I should give her a call
And make sure that you tell daddy that I'm still his little girl
Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me

Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray
Haven't done this in a while so I don't know what to say
But Lord I feel so small sometimes in this big old place
Yeah I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me
I'm taking over my body
Back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
"T"s uncrossed and "I"s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot
Like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, swat

I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

And I'll be holding on to you

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me"

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith



Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

And I'll be holding on to you



Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad
It cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain

'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me, I might just your heal
[Chorus] 
Take what you want, take what you wa-ah-aha-ant Take what you want, take what you want But, you gotta share it with the world X3

Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis 'Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new Fortunately I am at an elevated level I'm celebrated at home and I am high above it all But apologies to my fans that be super conscious Just wait 'til I get my money right and I am going to ball Ball ball 
[Chorus]
Uh ooh ooh uh ooh ooh uh ooh oooh

[Lykke Li]
Hands down
I'm too proud, for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of

both: But how we move from A to B 
[Drake]
It can't be up to me
Cause you don't know
Who i was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you

[Hook - Drake]
A little bit, a little bit 
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, 
oh oho

[Drake]
I know you don't break their hearts
but it's you I wanna take apart
and I will never ever be the first, to say it 
but still I they know I ah ah ah

[Lykke Li]
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
Cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit

I would do it
You'd say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha hm

[Hook - Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
In lalalala love with me

[Drake]
I hope they never find out 
What they already know, know, know 
As soon as its official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You can teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronon
Both N'Sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just soo wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas said I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say i ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more 
Oh well tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
Wit a girl that I know yeah tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know your the one 
The closest I've come
I'm probably a...

[Hook - Drake]
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
oh oho
lalalala love with me
oh oho, oh oho

Uh ooh ooh uh ooh ooh uh ooh oooh
oh oho, oh oho
[Verse 1:]
I'm not concerned with people 
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad

[Hook:]
Get dem haters out your circle 
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down 
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Verse 2:]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you dont know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

[Hook:]
[Bridge:]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Dont be fooled u betta recognize
They not there for you
They dont care for you
Trust me cuz i know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Hook]
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
This shit ain't gonna stop
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better

Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)

All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied 
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over 
The way you hurt me
I dont know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing 
The very thing you gave to me 
I thought I could forgive you and I know you've changed 
As much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same 
And it's all because you lied 

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and 
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling (you lied) like I was no good (you lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you, like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever (you lied)
More than my own life (you lied)
The best part of me I gave you (you lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied 

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive but I was here first
I've been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you probably thinking
"What's up with B?"
I've been crying for too long 
What did you do to me?

I use to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying

You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me 
But look what you've done to me now 

I gotta look at her in her eyes (you lied)
And see she's had half of me (you lied)
How could you lie? (How could you lie?)
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

Justin Bieber
I just can't wait

Mariah Carey
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

Mariah Carey
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
You, baby

Justin Bieber
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
(You baby)

Mariah Carey &amp; Justin Bieber
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Yeah

Mariah Carey
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own

Justin Bieber
For my own
Baby

Mariah Carey
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

Mariah Carey &amp; Justin Bieber
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You

That's all I want for Christmas
(All I want for Christmas is you baby)
That's all I want for Christmas (baby)
That's all I want babe
Yeah yeah
(baby) ohoh, ohoh
All I want ohoh
What I really want
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Where'd you go, huh?
They all think I know you,
It's so hard to motivate,
Me to devote a,
Single inch of me to,
Something I can't see I,
Don't mean to pry but why,
Would you even make the eyes?
I don't believe my ears,
And I'm scared of my own head,
I will deny you for years,
Then I'll make you raise me from the dead,
And if I said that I would live for you,
For nothing in return,
Well I'm sorry Mr. Gullible,
But lying's all I've learned,
So be concerned.

No music,
And I could talk about anything,
Whether or not it's worth while,
Is based on who's listening,
Most of us listen if it's,
Something we can relate to,
All of us relate,
If it's something we've just been through,
Take it for granted,
Trust is damaged and now we panic,
Living empty-handed,
Living lives like we can't manage, I can't feel you,
But still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded.
So be concerned.

I am disappearing,
Inside my bird's eye theories,
I try to say goodbye, defy, and deny,
What it is I'm fearing,
Clearly I am dying, dearly I am writing,
Merely testifying, that the test to fly requires I,
Pass the test with colors flying,
I don't believe you most the time,
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,
You are the pearl, I am the swine,
So break my life and take this rhyme,
I'm so sorry but I do believe,
That all my bridges, I have burned,
And I've earned a policy of no return,
So be concerned.
Unwrap your heart for me 

'Cause mint condition just means that you haven't been living
Who taught you to be so safe anyways? 
A scar is just a battle wound, it tells the tale of earlier days
Before cold feet, cold feet
Can't tell you your heart won't get broken, but
C'mon now - throw some caution to the wind
I'm throwing it to the wind
You could run away scared 
Or look it straight in the eye 
And tell it "I don't want you coming here no more!"
Don't wait for its reply
Tell me, what are you so afraid of?
Skinned knees and swaying trees?
The world outside? Oh honey, honey, please.
Don't be getting cold feet, cold feet
Can't tell you that your heart won't get broken, but
C'mon now - throw some caution to the wind
I'm throwing it to the wind
You say "You don't know what I've been through!"
Why don't you tell me then, 'cause I'd really like to
Don't keep your heart under lock and key
'Cause if you do it won't find its way to me
To me
I'm throwing it to the wind
I'm throwing it to the wind, oh
I'm throwing it to the wind
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought

You and me would stop this love drought
Hey girl, do you want my number
That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I don't expect nothing at all

What if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
All this lasts is just one night
Baby we should slow it down

Hey girl, I'm back in Atlanta
Seconds dates are lovely
This time you should choose where we go
Need suggestions, how about the movies
Then we go for ice cream
I'm not picky, you let me know

But what if we happen to kiss, and we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
All this lasts just one night
Baby we should slow it down

Girl I ain't pimp, girl I ain't a player, no
I ain't tryina move too fast so I'm just gonna take it slow
Girl I just wanna know
What would happen if we made love
Would we have the same feelings when we wake up
Will be still spends hours on the phone
Wishing we was alone
Would you speak to me in a totally different tone
I know but, I guarantee two thing in life
One is death and the other is I can change you whole life in one night
Doing wrong always feels so right

It can start up with kiss, leading to a touch
Forming a relationship based solely around lust
I'm trying to move slow, relaxing the drift
But every time I do my brain's reaction is this

What if we happen to kiss, and we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
All this lasts just one night
Baby we should slow it down

Maybe we should slow it down
If you're ready we can go all the way baby
We can go all the way
Baby we should slow it down

How ya doin', honey, baby?
You know I don't ask for much, but 
For a girl, spendin' time alone can be pretty rough...

But I get a knock on my door;
You know it's yours, for sure...
We can't wait for the bedroom, so we just hit the floor...

(Is y'all alright?) I don't know, but I know what's happened to me, girl, hey...

Well, if it ain't about lovin', and you gon' keep it comin',
Well, baby, with me, that's fine...

Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It's the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root 
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me 'p' pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane,
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

<div class="lyricbox">Pageant Host/Harvey Keitel: "Miss Third Ward, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?"
Miss Third Ward/Beyoncé: "Hoh... my aspiration in life? Would be... to be happy."

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl;
What's in your head, it doesn't matter...
Brush your hair, fix your teeth;
What you wear is all that matters..."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Blonder hair, flat chest;
TV says, "Bigger is better..."
South Beach, sugar-free;
Vogue says, "Thinner is better...."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts... (Pretty hurts...)

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away;
The pain's inside, and nobody frees you from your body...
It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery;
It's my soul that needs surgery...

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far,
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors, and the shards of a beautiful girl...

Pretty hurts; (Oh, oh...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Pretty hurts...)
Perfection is a disease of a nation; (Pretty hurts...)
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Oh! Oh, oh...)
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see; (Pretty hurts...)
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

When you're alone all by yourself, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
and you're lying in your bed, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Reflection stares right into you; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
You stripped away the masquerade, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
The illusion has been shed; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)

Yes...</div>
I thought I told you he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer in here
Like a fool for fire I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees

But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river, I cried
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

So, you thought that I would crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, will you leave your man?
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river, I cried
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look in your eyes and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

Well I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river, you'll cry
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl

You left me wanting what we were

Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away...just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl

You left me wanting what we were

Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever

[Verse 1]
Word on road, it's the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

[Hook]
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)

[Verse 2]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB (ah)

[Bridge]
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

[Hook]
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)

[Verse 3]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)

[Bridge]
[Outro]
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)

Good Ones Go
[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Summer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'm gonna need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
Should be tired of taking care of me right now

[Hook]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2]
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

[Hook]</div>
Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close

Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me

Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter

So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna feel so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming, hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart, art, art, art
It's California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

I love the way you make me feel;
I love it, I love it...

<u>Mac:</u>
Say... I’m thinking 'bout her every second, every hour,
Do my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,
"Do she love me, do she love me not?" (Love me not...)
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot... 

<u>Ariana:</u>
You give me that kind of something,
Want it all the time, need it every day...
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred;
Never get enough, I can’t stay away...

If you want it, I got it, I got it every day;
You can get whatever you need from me...
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you,
And I ain’t going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper

So don’t you worry - baby, you got me...
I got a bad boy, I must admit it; (Aye!)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it... (Aye!)
And I don’t care who sees it, babe;

'Cause boy, I know just what you like...

So If you need it, I got it, I got it every day;
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me...

Come and watch a movie with me - “American Beauty” 
Or “Bruce Almighty” that's groovy, just come and move closer to me...

Footsteps on the stairs
But not really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall
Whispers down the hall
When I look there's nothing to see

You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go cause this love is
Haunted
Oooh...

You say that she's gone
That you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains
Keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?

Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see
There's two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go cause this love is
Haunted
Oooh...

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(And ain't nothing I can do about it)

Noo... Noo...
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go cause this love is
Haunted
Oooh...

I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door...
<div class="lyricbox">Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he’s quite a man
He adores me, he’s my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong,
I know he’s not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he’s flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hole on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till i've had enough

Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till i've had enough</div>
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've got to find my own, my own

Yeah
More

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player - my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest"
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?
He stays home home for work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie but this time he decides that it's alright.
It's alright.
No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize before.
He goes to lock the door.

He is falling
And though he knows it's not
The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

We all need you now.
Someone said where you going
Someone said to you goodbye
They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the time.
We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.
And we blame it on the times.

Oh he is falling
And though he knows it's not
The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

We all need you now
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.
Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.
Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm

Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the camera go do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm

If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
<div class="lyricbox">Ariana Grande:
I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single
I don't really know what's next
But I ain't even tripping, I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right and the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex
You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn you're the best
Best, best

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinking 'bout it, boy it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me you're better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn I'm a mess
Mess, mess

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

Lil Wayne:
I said "girl, you need a hot boy"
She said "you need to stop fucking with those thots, boy"
I said "you need a real nigga", she said "yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X large, okay
Ariana my little momma, goodbye to the good girl
My ex trippin', it's no biggie, I tupac shook her
I'm laid up with my new thang
She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change
Then my name change from Lil Wayne to Oohhh Wayne, oh Lord
She grinding on this Grandè, oh Lord
I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love
She says she single and I'm her feature, oh my God

Ariana Grande + Lil Wayne:

Baby baby
When we first met I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left

I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like... oh!

You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug

The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
I gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like... oh!

You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door

Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease

I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease

Now ladies gimme that...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, ohh
Now gimme that...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, ohh

Verse 1.

I Feel Good, I Got Some Time Off Girl It's Been So Long,
Did You Have Fun, Cause I'ma Need A Cab Just To Get Me Home,
And Maybe You Can Call In Sick, Then Bring It To The Crib And Get All This,
I Know, I Know I'm Blunt But How Real Is That, You Want That Feeling' Back,
Then You Should Know.

Chorus.
I Still Got It For Ya' (x6)
And Even Though We Let It Go, It's Better That You Know,
And Even Though We Let It Go, It's Better That You Know, I Still.

Verse 2.
I Feel Good, I Got Some Time Off Girl It's Been So Long,
Did You Have Fun, Cause I'ma Need A Cab Just To Get Me Home,

[Verse 1]
Its ten o?clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Driving up and down your street hoping that you come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me (ohh)
Childish as it seems it'll make it all better (better)
Selfish as it is this just ain't about you (no)
Did me wrong every time were together (gether)

[Bridge]
And that's why I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could have made it all on my own?.
I don't ever ask you where you've been,
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with...
I can't even think straight, but I can tell
That you were just with her, and I'll still be your fool...
I'm a fool for you...

Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want...
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...

I don't ever tell you how I really feel,
Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean...
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say;
I know I'm not your only, but I'll still be your fool,
'Cause I'm a fool for you...

Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want...
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...

Just a little bit...
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one;
I heard a little love is better than none...
Oh, babe...

Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want...
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...

Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart, (Just a little bit, baby, baby,)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want... (Is all I want...)
Just a little bit of your heart (just a little bit), just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...
Yeah, yeah

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was all in
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face and it's just not the same

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day, I can see it like right away

Since then, things never been the same

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
(I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say

'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart’s a vacant house
When you’re gone away, it’s so empty
And love don’t make no sense when it’s empty (Oh no)

I’ve driven almost every car
It ain’t the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain’t the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain’t the same
If the picture ain’t got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain’t the same
If it ain’t about you, I don’t get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh

Don’t nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

Without you, girl I ain’t the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I’m incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo’d up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won’t you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don’t want to sleep 'less you at home

The first time I saw you
I thought you were barefoot
Your hair was pulled back, your jelly shoes, I was wondering if I should
Lie
About my age

Buddy Holly glasses on a Betty Page negative
You're looking so classic handpicked by some Hollywood executive
Just like Norma Jean
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Way oh

The next time I saw you, you asked for a reason
I let my love come down
Now you're spending all your time thinking how you're gonna get even
And I'm by myself
I can't believe I've fallen for you

Good morning now
It's a good morning

The Hollywood ending it never came easy
The bride to be can plainly see and now she says she's ready to kill me
And I'm so afraid
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now its over now
And your in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes your were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
Fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired

(I should have known)
Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe the trick me back into them even tho

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
Then I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired
Uh huh
It's Iggy Iggz!
I got one more problem with you, girl
(One less, one less problem)
Aye!

Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya (I want you-hou-hou)
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to (I want you-hou-hou)

Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it (I want you-hou-hou)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up (but it's you-hou-hou)
I know I shouldn't never call back
Or let you come back (but it's you-hou-hou)

Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it (but it's you-hou-hou)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

It's Iggy Iggz
Uh, what you got?

Smart money, bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you

Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson

No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million yous baby boy, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what!

One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
[Drake]
Yeah, look...
Me and sos? we from two different walks of life
Usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off the night
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphins white
Mislead drake that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time
They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

[Chorus: Sos &amp; Drake]
All I need is sum weight, my scale, sum money for bail
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin heavy on my waist man I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you kno who we are..
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please
How you choose to express yourself,
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally.

You follow what you feel inside,
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mmh, it comes naturally.

And it takes my breath away,
What you do, so naturally.

You are the thunder and I am the lightning,
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting,
When you know it's meant to be.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
When you're with me, baby.
Bay-bay-baby.

You have a way of moving me,
A force of nature, your energy,
It comes naturally, (You know it does)
It comes naturally. (Mmmm yeah)

And it takes my breath away, (Everytime)
What you do, so naturally.

You are the thunder and I am the lightning,
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting,
When you know its meant to be.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
When you're with me, baby.
Bay-bay-baby.

When we collide, sparks fly,
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away.
(You are!)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning,
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting,
When you know its meant to be.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
When you're with me, baby.
Bay-bay-baby

Everything baby comes naturally, yeah.

(feat. J-Status)

Ooh Yeah 
Yeah yea

(Verse 1)
When you stand so close to me
Im feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

(Chorus)
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to 
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
whoa ho yeah

(Verse 2)
My bestfriends tell me Rihanna
what's got into you
I say Rihandra I can't explain 
These feelings Im going through
Tell me girl it's not like you to fall this way
I try my best to wear a disguise 
But it's written on my face

(Chorus)
(J-Status)
Yeah
It's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl for you missing the song yeah
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay 
If you wanna
Come on my bajun baby 
Let me take to jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing 
For the loving where you are
So baby your my number 1 my number 2
So if its loving that you want 
Baby you should make me your boo

(Chorus)
(Bridge)
Don't understand the meaning

Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many [?]
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh
[?]

[CHORUS]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[DRAKE]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane [?]
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
[?] Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
[?] Pass the torch and sell they soul [?]
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they [?] to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and [?] dro and twenty stacks
[?]
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap! 
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at! 

[CHORUS]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Your name

Bet you wanna put your name on it
Your name on it, b-b-b-uh

It's not even my birthday
But he wanna lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way
Can't wait to blow my candles out
He want that

Cake cake cake cake cake
(Bet you wanna put your name on it)

Ooh baby I like it
You so excited
Don't try to hide it
Imma make you my bitch

Cake cake cake cake cake
(Bet you wanna put your name on it)

I know you wanna bite this
It's so enticing
Nothing else like this
Imma make you my bitch

And it's not even my birthday
Bet you wanna put your name on it
And he try'na put his name on it

I wanna fuck you right now
Just get up on my body
I'd do anything
This boy here wants to move too fast
He see's my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

That boy there, well he's playing a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
We'll I don't think so
I don't think so

Cheap date, bad taste another night gone to waste
Talking about nothing in so many words
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

And, I , I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog

Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games radier nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

And, I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog

Why can't they be like the one's that mean everything to me
Warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not trying 
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my

I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog

The more I love my dog
Lately, nothing I do ever seems to please you
And maybe turning my back would be that much easier,
Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I can't watch you walk away
Could I forget about the way it feels to touch you?
And all about the good times that we've been through?
Could I wake up without you everyday, would I let you walk away?

No I can't learn to live without
And I can't give up on us now.

Chorus:
Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
A promise not to miss you
Now and try to hide the truth inside
I fail cause I just can't live a lie

Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me?
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy,
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe,
The way you know just what I mean,

No I can't learn to live without, oh,
So don't you give up on us now.

Chorus
(Instrumental)
And I don't wanna try
When I try to hide the truth inside
I fail cause I just can't live a lie
I can't live a lie
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like puttin' fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried 'bout
Ooh you know females
And how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood (don't change your mood)

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, sometimes be your best friend
Perfect - ain't saying that I am
Proven, least I'm provin' that I give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I outta be to you, to you
Envy, envy
Same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
Try'na tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No, no I ain't all bad
(I ain't all bad)

I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elavated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a century
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo'
Converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight by
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
I been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Oh yeah

Santa honey, the one thing that I really do need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring, but I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

So hurry down the chimney tonight (waiting)
Hurry tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
I remember being young and so brave, I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back daydreaming
Look at me, I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town, now, bitches, I run this... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can do wrong if I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

They love the way I walk, 'cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk, 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, it's 'bout time I show it... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
And I know that I got it (Got it, got it)
Ain't got no room in my pockets (Ah)

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha hada alot a game, and he open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and im so glad that he's all mine

(Hook) There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I dont care whos hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but everytime that he's around
My heart dont lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud

(Hook)
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

(Rap)
T-H-U-G in ya life baby
One in a million thats what you are to me
Anda I know your friends say im rough
But I still got that tender touch just to make u giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be alot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving and loving thats all im giving

(Bridge)
Mama dont worry, im not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know its the real thing, if you dont whatever
And I know its meant to be

(Hook)
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

(Bridge)
Mama dont worry, im not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry
Verse 1:
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (baby)
If you let him take me from you

Verse 2:
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see

If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (baby)
If you let him take me from you

Bridge:
Boy when i try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
Thats when its cool
But baby boy i'm not a fool

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
You never wanted me (wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (no no)
That your love was never true (no no)
If you let him take me from you 
(how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you

I guess i finally see
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)
That your love was never true (let me go)
If you let him take me from you (just let me kno)
If you let him take me from you
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls

I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can you keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
'Cause...

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you

Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

I don't want nothing else
Not when I had the best
Because you showed me the best

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh
Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...

No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
It's really been weighing on me,
tell me what did I do?
To have ya'll hatin on me,
when I don't have nothin' to prove.
Sometimes I shake my head,
when I'm layin' down in my bed.
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
when you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.
You must admire me,
spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

It's really been weighing on me,
i'm not myself lately.
I feel a little incomplete,
but i'm not gonna lose no sleep.
I keep it all in my mind,
cause it gotta get better in time.
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine.

Gotta clear up some things

Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...
Yeah
There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go

Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin

It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize

Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
and felt our love begin

It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..
I've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
Always stumblin' around in circles
But I must have stumbled into something
Look at me
Am I really alone with you?

I wake up feeling like my life's worth living
Can't recall when I last felt that way
Guess it must be all this love you're giving
Never knew never knew
It could be like this

But I guess
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side

Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes

Some hearts just get lucky lucky sometimes
Now who'd have thought someone like you could love me?
You're the last thing my heart expected
Who'd have thought I'd ever find somebody?
Someone who someone who
Makes me feel like this

Well I guess
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side

Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes

Some hearts just get lucky
Sometimes

Ooh
Even hearts like mine
Get lucky
Lucky sometimes
Even hearts like mine

Ooh
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side

Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky
Sometimes

Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side

Some hearts
They just have it so easy

Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Sometimes

Some hearts just get lucky
Sometimes
Ooh
There's miles of land in front of us
And we're dying with every step we take
We're dying with every breath we make
And I'll fall in line

A stranger's back is all I see
He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line

No one looks up anymore
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line

And about this time every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep

And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question
Why I fall in line

Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head:
Follow me instead

Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:
This line's the only way

And then I start down the stand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says,
Follow me instead

Take me up, seal the door
I don't want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So I'll follow You instead

So then You put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea
I love you

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop
I am the sea
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful
To have you by my side

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel
To breathe
To love you

Dangerously in love
Can't do this thing
I love you , I love you, I love you
I'll never leave
Just keep on loving me
I'm in love with you
I can not do
I cannot do anything without you in my life
Holding me, kissing me, loving me
Dangerously
I love you
Dangerously in love

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me
Must be yo mission 
'Cause with every hug and kiss 
You're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable 
And it's a heartbreaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do, 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right take me high
Then that high, it subsides 
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive 
Wait, wait, wait... I'm alive
But how long will it last 
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No), it's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself, this can't do (Can't do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)
It's so unfair, (Unfair) that I find myself right back in your care (Care)
And what's good is that when you are not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Baby kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, ooh
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here
In your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
It's so cold
In your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time;
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind...
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here....

I want to say I lived each day until I die,
And know that I meant something in somebody's life...
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here....

I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
Left this world a little better, just because I was here...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved...) 
I was here...
(I did,) I did! (I've done...) 
I was here!
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved) I loved!
I was here... (Oh, ooh, ooh...)
I did, I've done...
I was here.

(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
You don't need a lot of money, and you don't have to play no games;
All I need is all your lovin' to get the blood rushing through my veins...

I wanna say we're going steady like it's 1954;
Now, it doesn't have to be forever,
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Ooh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Whoa-oh-oh, yeah...

You don't need to worry about makin' me crazy, 'cause I'm way past that;
So just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me, and I'll show you
How much I wanna be on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby, and lay me in your bed,
And kiss me underneath the moonlight;
Darlin', let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh, babe...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing

Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I'mma hit it like I'm on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I'mma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon' need it
I'm off that la-la
I'mma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yea

And sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I'm saucy
And it's always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I'mma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We're not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it'll feel alright
The sex doesn't get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I'm Monroe
Even if I'm alone

Sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptations
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me so amazing
(this is the best there is)
Ariana Grande:
Tell me something I need to know,
Then take my breath and never let it go...
If you just let me invade your space,
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain...

And if in the moment, I bite my lip,
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss;
Give me a reason to believe in...

'Cause if you want to keep me, 
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
And if you really need me, 
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... (Baby, love me harder...)

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...

The Weeknd:
I know your motives, and you know mine;
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind...
If you know about me, and choose to stay,
Then take this pleasure, and take it with the pain...

And if in the moment, you bite your lip,
When I get you moanin', you know it's real...
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make you feel like the first time...

Ariana Grande, [The Weeknd]:
'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder; [I'ma love you harder...]
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... [Baby, love me harder...]

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder... (Gotta love me harder...)

The Weeknd: So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
Ariana Grande: You got to try, try, try again, yeah...
Ariana Grande: I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again...

Ariana Grande, [The Weeknd]:
'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
[I'ma love you, love you, love you...]
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... 
(Love me, love me, baby...)
'Cause if you wanna keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;

And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder...

Drake:
Yeh, ah . . . ah
Boi-1da! . Drizzy!
Ahah.Uh

Yall don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside da pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, aah, you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, aah , you staying broke
Chilling if even if I'm in a goose down coat
I cant see you through the Mosley Tribes
So i don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up, but there's no one my size
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write-off
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cuz It's about to go.

BEAT PLAYS
I hear my phone ringing when ya call
I aint picking up or entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down, banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that a got from out-of-state
Riding with a swag that a got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest imma knock him out his place
Call me homicide drizzy, about to kill your ego
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like i'm Cee Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah ma g-pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl
While she's smiling back at me like.

BEAT PLAYS
You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing

Talk about when we were children
Not the kinda kid that you believe in
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
Yeah you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

You saw me on a television
Hanging on my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit you shake your head at my decision

I guess the kinda songs that I been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah you saw on a television

But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it, yeah
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

Oh you know me, I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody falling in love
Oh you know me, everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck

And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah this the life I live
And that's just the half of it

Yeah you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the half of it, hey, no...

You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television
Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...

No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Ahh, ahh, ahh all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now 
(Uh-huh... Toney Starks.. 
Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody 
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma 
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby 
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here 
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo?) 

I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last 
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past 
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids 
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that 
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man 
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women 
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't 
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own 
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home 
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes 
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know 
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low 
It took me some time, but now I am strong 
Because I realized I got.. 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself) 
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out) 
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way) 
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again) 

See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now.. 
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry.. 
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot.. 
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now 
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about 
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset 

Changes... we all go through changes 
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous 
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and 
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous 
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone 
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone 
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts 
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts 
So I could continue to hold down the foundation 
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations 
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations 
We act off our emotions and we start hatin' 
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss 
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces 
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out 
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out 
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie 
Please try, be mine til we die 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

(Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
Beyonce.. beautiful girl
I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
The one I wake up thinking about
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you till the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect

I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
I'm the one you wake up thinkin' 'bout
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you till the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces
You're my kind of perfect
Right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time 
Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well, I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
This was all you
None of it me
You put your hands all 
Over my body and told me
Mmm... you told me you were ready
For the big one
For the big jump
I'd be your last love 
Everlasting you and me
Mmm... that was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...

I was too strong
You were trembling
You couldn't handle
The hot heat rising 
(Rising)
Mmm... baby, I'm so rising
I was running
You were walking
You couldn't keep up
You were falling down
(Down)
Mmm... there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh...

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...

If you're ready
I am ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...

If you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
Are you ready? 
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
(Oh...)
If you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
Are you ready? 
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
[Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited

I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"

And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded

She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya

Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved

There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right, all right

(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right, all right

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle

My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night

After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing

And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper

We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married

Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right, all right

(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right, all right
Feel the adrenaline
Moving under my skin
It's and addiction
Such an eruption

Sound is my remedy
Feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dancefloor
Bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard
Blazing through my beating heart

French kissing on the floor
Heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy off the crazy juice
This will end up on the news

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Ultrassexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh oh oh ooh oh

Ultrassexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum...

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
<div class="lyricbox">Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-uh...

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)

You was on the wall, I was with my crew;
You was watching me, baby, I was watching you...
Slowly, you walked over - I maintained my cool;
You said hello to me, I said hello to you...
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do;
You somehow intrigued me - I thought you were so cool...
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable;
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you...

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)

"Certainly you can call me, baby, I love to hear from you..."
"Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy;
Wanna get to know you more, sure, I’m feelin' you..."
"No, baby, not yet, we can’t take that next step;
Why you gettin’ so upset? Boy, you
Act as though I never told you yes before - You are so ungrateful! Mm-mm-mm..."

You was at my house, I was sittin' on my couch;
You was really buggin', so I told you to get out...
I had been misjudging you - You had a lot of nerve;
You too damn old to be so immature! I hope you learn...
You said I move too slow, I showed you to the door;
You said you'd call me later, I said, "Don't call no more..."
It is cool if you can't wait for me, I'm glad you let me know,
'Cause you showed me your true face, baby, the first time I said no...

I said yes to your number, (Yes...) and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, (Ooh...) we can be together, but you gotta (Mm-mm...) wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
(Ooh, I said yes!) I said "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
(Oh...) But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
(The very first time I say no...) The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes..." before...)

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;

9-1-1, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run run run,
Come and charge him with the 143, yeah yeah
Told me this one was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now he's done done done and his love is no more for me

Another year as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?

I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah yeah yeah
Boy, yeah yeah yeah

Fe fo fum like the sky is falling down on me
Numb numb numb, he's so cold he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Gwan and put 'im away
He's the only one one one I ever let get the best of me

Another year as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?

I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah yeah yeah
Boy, yeah yeah yeah

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?

No love, no love, no love allowed
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses what he stole on a grave

He pretends he's okay but you should see
Oh him in bed late at night he's petrified
Take me out finish this waste of a life

Everyone one gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch as him fall through a bleeding trapdoor

He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills man faster than his own hand
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

He pretends he's okay but should see
him in bed late at night he's petrified
Take me out and finish this waste of a life

Everyone one gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch as him fall through a bleeding trapdoor

Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone one gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor
Cause nobody know his life
I can't take them on my own, my own
Oh, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Do do do do do do do do

Do

I am up against the wall, the wall
For, I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Do do do do do do do do

Do do do do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Cold nights under
Siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder
In one way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Tonight, I'll need you to stay
I know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong

Lately, you make me feel all I am is a backup plan
I'll say I'm done and then you smile at me and I'll forget
Everything I said...

I buy into those eyes and into your lies
CHORUS 
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.

I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
Still no sound

Of footsteps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere

CHORUS 
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.

I'm performin' tonight you know that shit gon' be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it's exact
My ex girl I'll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing I.D.
But the young trend setting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring yo' misses By me I'm it I'm it call me Mr. I.T.
If I get one wish Imma wish to die free
They say gon' head, ball like Mrs. Ivory, And I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
Soho, Cosmo, Bah Mar blow fish?
Let's make a toast, tell yo' friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

We doin' it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I'm is
It's only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That's all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It's about time that you made it
I was bumping yo' songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beat in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can't sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the fax and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murry look at what my talent did
And what yo' business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it
Its always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you comin' the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach ya
My plan just hatched, happy Easter

I'm doin' it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I'm is
It's only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That's all I got to say
At the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I'm in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I'm neva looking down so I always know wassup.
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck T's
And I never trust a nigga sayin' trust me
Nick Cannon and Will never did it this ill
So you tell don't you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to uncle Steve my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn't leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Cher
I'll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel I hope Heavens prepared for whenever you there

Uhh, I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through ya Stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don't cry for me this ain't mothafucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn't at my session
It's the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

Look at what I done
Look at where I'm is
It's only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That's all I got to say
At the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
Wouldn't wanna be anybody else,
Hey!

You made me insecure,
Told me I wasn't good enough.
But who are you to judge,
When you're a diamond in the rough.
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself,
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else.

Keep you beneath the stars,
Won't let you touch the sky.

What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide 
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count, 'cause you can't get it back 

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And then you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else 
Seem so small, yeah yeah
Thinkin' of you, yeah, I think of you all day, 
Think of your kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss on my lips... 
I'll remember this always. 

Got the goofiest grin, got a big smile on my face. 
Hey, you, let's get out, out, out of this place. 
Grab my hand, let's go! 

See, it's young love at its best! 
And I tell you I'll remember... 

Breakin' you out through your bedroom window, 
Sneakin' you into my parents' house, 
Stayin' out all night, into the morning, 
Into the morning. 

Breakin' you out through your bedroom window, 
Sneakin' you into my parents' house, 
Stayin' out all night, into the morning, 
Until the sun comes up and ruins it all... 

Monday morning, first class, ditch it. 
We'll hang out, out, out in the parking lot, 
Only the two of us... 

We'll make out 'til the stars come up, lay and watch them. 
That one looks just like the one in your eyes... 
Come on, grab my hand, let's go! 

Young love at its best! 
And I tell you I'll remember... 

Breakin' you out through your bedroom window, 
Sneakin' you into my parents' house, 
Stayin' out all night, into the morning, 
Into the morning. 

Breakin' you out through your bedroom window, 
Sneakin' you into my parents' house, 
Stayin' out all night, into the morning, 
Until the sun comes up and ruins it all... 

Drinkin' peach schnapps, and hangin' out in our underwear, 
Goin' to parties and leavin', 'cause there's no one there. 
Skip third class, 'cause really? We don't even care 
About anything at all. 

We'll get tattoos we swear we'll never hate, 
Break the rules and stay out way too late. 
Well, ain't life grand? But isn't it great 
Having no care in the world? 

See, it's young love at its best! 
And I tell you I'll remember... 

Breakin' you out through your bedroom window, 
Sneakin' you into my parents' house, 
Stayin' out all night, into the morning, 
Into the morning. 

Breakin' you out through your bedroom window, 
Sneakin' you into my parents' house, 
Stayin' out all night, into the morning, 
Until the sun comes up and ruins it all... 

Well, it's young love at its best, 
And it's you that I'll remember...

You are worthy of all of the love in the world,
You are the love of my life.

Now's all we got,
And time can't be bought,
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember

You said you loved me,
I said I loved you back,
What happened to that?

All your promises,
And all them plans we had,
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember

The trips we dream of takin',
The tags left on the map,
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing,
When all we did was laugh,
What happened? what happened?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember 

Break down the walls,
Let heaven in,
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again,
We used to be inseparable,
I used to think that I was irreplaceable,
We lit the whole world up,
Before we blew it up,
I just don't know how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember 
Money, cars, clothes,
The hoes, I suppose
YUP

[Hook - Trey Songz]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be successful.

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Drizzy,
Ah yeah Trey I fuckin feel you,
They be starin at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it, I live it,
To me there's nothing realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much will kill ya,
And when I leave I always come right back here,
The young spitta that everybody in rap fear,
A lot of y'all are still soundin like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the mofucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush, shape the lines in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah, I want it all, that's why i strive for it,
Dis me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I get fly for it,
I know that it's comin' i just hope that I'm alive for it.

[Hook - Trey Songz]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be successful.

[Verse 2 - Drake]
Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been goin sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car, so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me, so I cried too,
And my stomach was soakin wet she only 5'2,
And 48 hours was all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn. My reality just set in,
And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things hopin I neva have to fit in,
So tryin to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week so 
It's good but I know this aint the peak though,
Cause I want...

[Hook - Trey Songz]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be successful.

[Verse 3 - Drake]
Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was tryin to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treadin waters steady tryin to swim to shore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me "Shopping Bag Drizzy"
And call me "Mr. damn he aint copin that is he?"
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this young'n that you doubtin is about to get busy,
Imma kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I aint askin for much
All I want is the...

[Trey Songz]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be successful.

Yeah
Its like i know what i got to say,
i just don't know how to say it to you

[Verse 4 - Lil' Wayne]
Uh
Pardon the swag, but bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I cant miss courtdates,
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait,
Yeah, life's fine but I don't portray,
I'm on the other side, but it is a sharp gate,
I don't want the glow, I want the glo'ray,
And Imma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
Now, that's word to Toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell god,
Weezy baby I go real hard,
No further details boy.

Danger, oh, how you hold me
I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me, baby, oh

Ariana Grande:
Is it love when so easily said goodbye?
Is it love when we’ve given up before we tried?
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?

So when you walk out that door
Don’t you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

You’re a dangerous love
And baby, you’re no good for me, darling
Cause if you’re gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I’d rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
You’re a dangerous love

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy

Black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib telling ya girl that we should order in

We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn
I'm so catch-trina smarter than a lot of these niggas
Swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water winnnnggggs
I'm still myself, suicide bars I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I'll bill myself and
I don't feel ya'll but I feel myselllf
&amp; to those tell em' I deserve a mazeltov
I'm rappin like a shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow—pause
And I can't hear the critics talking over the applause
Yeah
I tried to tell em', Future let em' know
Send the haters all my love—X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than ya dreams are
I got ya dream girl riding in ya dream car
Yeah and the visual is stunning
I hope they document what I'm becoming
Congratulations

[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or suttin?
I'm at the private airport boarding suttin'
I see nothin' from afar but I'm far from nothin'
Put on your poker face
I'll pull ya card if ya bluffinnnnn'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world records—no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or suttin'
My deal like Weezy first week—1 point suttin'
And my verses getting stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars—can you pick me up from Jupiterrrr?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it dow-ownnnn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you could never be my ass—pause
Again, damnit ya'll? Again?
Ya'll, pretend that we are some men that get it on and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll, then don't bother him 
and yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right... Uh

["oh" ad-libs]
[Verse 3]
It's like
These days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothing but a protégé
But if you watched the VMA's there's nothing more to sayyy
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like ya bought a poppy 
and damn how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow they say get it off your chestttt
And I'm what all the fuss about and if they talking
I bet I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office—same extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should pay attention

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's crack
A yo Drizzy—you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like: "congratulations"
It's crack
Yeah
It's crack (ha ha)
Congratulations
Ladies and gentlemannn</div>
We were inseparable (inseparable)
Everything I had to do I did it next to you (next to you)
And the memories we made are so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
'Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
Then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

You got used to being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to being alone, all alone
Oooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happenin'
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could've divided my time
I should've fractioned it
But

There was nothing that I could do ooh
'Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
Then your heart fills up with so much aggression baby

You got used to being alone (alone), alone (all alone)
You adapted (you adapted) now you're used to (forgive me for you)
being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
Oooh you got used to being (used to) on your own
(All on your own)
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold
Oh
She gon' love that... I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
If I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Uh,
I forgot to call you on your birthday 
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it 
All you ever asked me for was time

[Bridge]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to 
And I finally get a moment to myself 
I will realize you were everything I’m missing 
And you’ll tell me you’re in love with someone else

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor? 
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And I'll realize I waited too long
But please don’t move on 
You don’t need no one else
You don’t need no one else 

[Verse 2]
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go 

[Bridge]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself 
I will realize you were everything I’m missing 
And you’ll tell me you’re in love with someone else

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor? 
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And ill realize I waited too long
But please don’t move on
You don’t need no one else 
You don’t need no one else

[Verse 3]
The girl or the world 
You see someone gotta lose 
I thought I could have it all 
Do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash 
If it doesn’t buy time 
And what good is being famous 
If I'm never on your mind 
Nights fallin 
Lights glowin 
And I'm just tryin to pay the price on
And I don’t wanna feel the comfort from my ice showin 
And I ain't tryin to be with out you at the right moments 
Nigga nice going is it worth it? 
That decision cuz hearts breaking 
I ain't tryin ta be in that collision 
So imma dust my shirt and fix my pants 
Cuz I better look good girl if this my chance I swear 

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor 
If I pull it together

<div class="lyricbox">What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn’t
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven
It seems like you don’t want this love anymore
I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love</div>

It's not just something you take, it's given

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall

Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business 
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations Imma exceed it uh
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here Imma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
MY pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!

You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[VERSE 3: Nickelus F]
[CHORUS:]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Here we are
midair off of the cliff
staring down at the end again
but then again maybe we're finally
on the road that's heading away from all your complaining
of hearing the same song but baby we'll hear it when i'm gone

it's time to turn on the last song
ooh
the last song

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
it was ours

But I'd do it again holding hands with my friend again
but then again maybe we gave our all
baby let them play it, maybe it'll save the world
they gonna miss hearing it when it's gone

but it's time to turn on the last song
ooh
the last song

what if we left every moment that we could spare
and the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear

you'll never know when the songs gonna play
the last song you'll hear is the one you made
your song was beautiful that's why I started singing it
but this song is our song it's playing until the end even if it's the last song

the last song
ooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
and the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
ooh
<div class="lyricbox">Oh he gave up on arrows a long, long time ago,
Turns out I’m too hard to hit so he put away his bow,
I might just keep on runnin’ from here to Timbuktu,
‘Cause he gave up on arrows, and I ain’t bulletproof.

Yeah, Cupid’s got a shotgun aiming at my heart,
I’ve been dodging bullets, I’ve been hiding in the dark,
Sawed off double barrel, trigger happy as can be,
Cupid’s got a shotgun and he’s pointing it at me.

He’s sitting in that tree stand and his wings are camouflage,
I’m dug down in my foxhole waiting on his next barrage,
Must be open season, got a target on my back,
He keeps throwing love grenades and I’m under attack.

Yeah, Cupid’s got a shotgun aiming at my heart,
I’ve been dodging bullets, I’ve been hiding in the dark,
Sawed off double barrel, trigger happy as can be,
Cupid’s got a shotgun and he’s pointing it at me. 
(Yeah)

Well he’s got me in his sights, I’ve got a red dot on my chest,
But little does he know I strapped on my Kevlar vest,
I pulled out my Remington and I loaded up these shells,
He’s about to find out I’m a dang good shot myself.

Yeah, Cupid’s got a shotgun aiming at my heart,
I’ve been dodging bullets, I’ve been hiding in the dark,
Sawed off double barrel, trigger happy as can be,
Cupid’s got a shotgun and he’s pointing it at me,
Yeah Cupid’s got a shotgun,
But right now he’s running from me, wooh.</div>
You said to meet you on the flipside, baby

I'd love to, I'd love to
You promised things will be different, maybe
I'll believe you honey, I'll believe you
You say you're ready for commitment
Oh my, there you go with your wandering eye
You leave me, regret it and you come crawling back
I tell you I hate you but I'll still let you in
You say "old dogs can't learn new tricks"
But on the flip flip flipside
Where the right is wrong and wrong feels so right
And every single mind-numbing fight
Only makes me love you more
I'm dreaming of the flip flip flipside
Where white is black and black is snow white
And every single heartbreaking night
Only makes me love you more
There may be other lovers
Some might offer diamonds
Some might offer me the world, I don't want them
'Cause honey they're not you
You're running through my veins
I try to detox but you're still in my system
Honey, I'm damaged goods
You broke it so you bought it
When you're not with me I forget how to function
Oh honey, honey, no
I will not let this go!
I keep holding out, keep holding onto
The flip flip flipside
Where the right is wrong and wrong feels so right
And every single mind-numbing fight
Only makes me love you more
I'm dreaming of the flip flip flipside
Where white is black and black is snow white
And every single heartbreaking night
Only makes me love you more
I've been living with devils and angels, angels, angels,
Realised you were not in the same boat, same boat, yeah.
Kills me how you love me, then you cut me down, I'll do the same,
We been living like angels and devils, devils.

I'm loving the pain, I never wanna live without it,
So why do I try?
You drive me insane, now we're screaming just to see who's louder,

You got me like,
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na,
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na.

Ooh, yeah...
You and I redefine being lovesick, lovesick, lovesick,
Through it all you can still make my heart skip, heart skip, yeah.
Even when you're yelling at me, I still think you're beautiful,
Through it all you can still make my heart skip, heart skip.

I'm loving the pain, I never wanna live without it,
So why do I try?
You drive me insane, now we're screaming just to see who's louder,

You got me like,
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na,
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na.

Ooh, baby, look at us,
We've been living like angels, living like devils.
We've been loving like angels, loving like devils.

Ooh, baby, look at us,
We've been living like angels, living like devils.
We've been loving like angels, loving like devils.

Ooh, baby, look...
I'm in love with the pain, I never wanna live without it,
So why do I try? (Do I try?)
You drive me insane, now we're screaming just to see who's louder,
So why do I try?

You got me like,

(Yeah)
(Hey)

I met him on my birthday

He was a present to me from the stars
They all said "Happy Birthday, girl"
Then they tore my world apart.
They put me on the east side
And they left him in L.A.
The distance grew between us
And we broke up yesterday
But if I cry myself a river, I can swim back to my sweet California
Give me a
C - A - L - I
I never knew I could feel like that
F - O - R - N
Anyone could tell you that I've got it bad
I - A, I - A, 
I ain't going down this way
I'm gonna cry myself a river so I can swim back to my sweet California
They're telling me I cry too much
That I could fill every bath and sink
In this city I got stuck in
With its tragic symphonies
They warned me not to get attached
But they got to me way too late
'Cause I'm thinking of him constantly-
Every moment I'm awake
But if I cry myself a river, then I can swim back to my sweet California
Give me a
C - A - L - I
I never knew I could feel like that
F - O - R - N
Anyone could tell you that I got it bad
I - A, I - A, 
I ain't going down this way
I'm gonna cry myself a river, then I can swim back to my sweet California
Cold water bring me back to my senses
Cold water, let me drown in him
Cold water, bring me back to my senses
Cold water, bring me back to him
Oh give me a
C - A - L - I
I never knew I could feel like that
F - O - R - N
Anyone could tell you that I got it bad
I - A, I - A, 
I ain't going down this way
I'm gonna cry myself a river so I can swim back to my sweet California
Justin Bieber

Drake
Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine

Selfish of me to ask since I be the reason we don't last forever
Wish that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need
I won't leave you baby no
'Cause I just wanna love ya
I would never ever put nobody up above ya
I just wanna kiss ya baby
I just wanna hug ya till the end, baby till the end

Waitin' on a good thing, when the time's right
You should let me get to know you baby

Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said "I heard you back with you know who
I told her "Girl I'm always back with you know who"
And she like "Who are we kidding
You're only 27 you just being you
You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm "Game of Thrones" with it momma
I'm " Home Alone" with it momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma
Them niggas wannabes momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I don't call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life
Ruby I hope I see you, I've waited all this week
For you to walk my way, your soul will capture me
Your momma painted your room a shade of pink, she said
But with your great arrival that shade has turned to red

Ruby take my hand, please lead me to the Promised Land
Tell me, where am I from, your eyes say, "Shada de da dum"
Ruby, you're royalty, in your homeland, they all call you "Queen"
Tell me, where are you from, your eyes say, "Shada de da dum"

You're an angel fallen down, won't you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky, how high? how high?

You're true and pure
You hold the cure
We're all diseased
You hold the key
Tell our dad, "I'm sorry"
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phones
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Worst motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions,
Nigga' we don't know shit
Flex, nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you,
Ahh - I'm glad that they chose us
Command, it's a mission,
Trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us,
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us, remember?
Motherfucker, remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior,
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior

Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done grown up
You know me, you know me
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O.D.B.

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us,
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us, remember?
Motherfucker, remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior,
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior

Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks,
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp,
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L.A.,
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Remember?
Motherfucker
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Motherfucker never loved us
Motherfucker
Worst behavior

We just don't want you to get sprung
On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs
Get all up in your heart and then run
Gettin' your heart broke is no fun
Neither is somebody telling you he not the one
You gotta learn for yourself though
And if you don't experience things 
Then you'll never know
I don't want you wishing

Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing

You have given me something I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to mean
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me
Ariana Grande:
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left,
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

Big Sean:
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

Ariana:
Break up, make up, total waste of time;
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hmm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hmm, hold on, yeah.

(Sean:)
You're, you're, you're, you're,
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

You're, you're, you're, you're,
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.
(Be-be-be-best)
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in sun's peace of mind
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you, that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do

I'd live for you, and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming
Like who would you live for, who would you die for
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride, oh oh, yeah

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my

I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, I've been thinking too much
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
I will always love you
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

Stupid in love
Oh

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size ten
In my whole life

I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

Don't understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid

I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

My new nickname
Is you idiot
(Such an idiot)
Thats what my friends

Are calling me when
They see me yelling
Into my
Phone

They tell me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it

Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you
Waste your time
You know he ain't right

Telling me this
I don't wanna listen
But you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid

I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep
Holding on
But the dunce cap is off

You don't know what you lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us
Is really done

Ooh
No
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid

I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
In love

As the music plays emotions rise

In your eyes I see three words 
Hold me tight cause I'm about burst
I think I'm ready

I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control 
You haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do 
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Baby I'm not afraid to go the way 
But it's my first time (it's my first time ahh ahh)

Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses dripping in diamonds, sipping on champagne
She was all uptown wearing that white gown, taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises covered in make-up, dark sunglasses
And that next morning sitting in the back pew praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee Whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery 
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing
A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly

Be the one, be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
To take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know
You can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
You make the fire and my bones will make it grow

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly

Put away, put away
All the gods your father served today
Your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know
How to put back the power in our soul
Where to find what once was in our bones

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words and
Swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire

Fair maiden Rihannagate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm'a be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I want (you)

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words and
Swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower

Make me your priority
There's nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm'a be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I want (you)

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

Homie don't beat it like a bullet
Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie

(I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover
(I love it when you)

Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy
We can do this all day

Be my Harlem
And me St. Tropez
Never found nobody
That will do it this way

No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I want (you)

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go
Is this a dream
Looking like every picture
That I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before
Now that it's over. I shoulda known better

Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause I feel
You needed time

But I kept thinking
This could be something
This could be
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all...

I guess it's what we make it
I guess it's what we...

I fell in love.
I didn't want to but you snuck right in,
Tripped me and watched me tumble
Head over heels over you -
Then watched me hit the ground.
I let you in 'cause 
I like what you're saying! :

"c'mon, we're going out tonight 
-don't try to run - don't try to hide
- don't even try to fight - I'm taking over
- we're gonna get this right 
- c'mon, we're going out tonight"

And there goes my heart...
Falling apart...tonight

I fell in love.
I didn't wan't to but you got me drunk,
Too drunk to argue.
I built these walls for a reason -
Then I watched you tear them down.

...boom boom boom goes my heart beat
'cause there's a knock knock knock on the door:
It's the missing piece of the puzzle
That I've spent my life looking for!

"c'mon, we're going out tonight 
-don't try to run - don't try to hide
- don't even try to fight - I'm taking over
- we're gonna get this right 
- c'mon, we're going out tonight"

And there goes my heart...
Falling apart...tonight
Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Ohh...

We're like diamonds in the sky

A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I

Eye to eye, so alive

Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star, I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in its path
Thinking that you might get off for that

I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time

I'll move on, baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you

I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end it wasen't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow

I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but i'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you

Oh, oh, someday
Oh, someday

I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
Oh, oh
Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
I, I'm terrified but I'm not leaving (No No)
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)
[Talking:]
Yeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find now-a-days it's just best to keep quiet
But uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion
You know what it is, uh

[Drake:]
Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here I got chauferred
Bring me champagne flutes,
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder,
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot 'Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin', I never do it second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
'Cause we have nothin' in common
Since I done became star
I done became big swervin' right in to my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I'll without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's wakin' up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause a eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous 'cause
Them hipsters gon' have to get alone with them hood niggas
It's all good I'm goin off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta rent a movie call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but I'm no "joker"
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and Tez got a sig' but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me nigga no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over,
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some Southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D.R., C.J, an Po I see y'all

These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go

[Lil' Wayne:]
And I take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, big location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me Young Roy
Jones Junior fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheese head word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recordin'
I ain't recordin' I'm jus C4'in
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage
Better cover ya eyes ya face fallin'
Watch the game from the side I'm play callin'
No I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I, damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for ya garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K Y no homo I'm on it
Weezy F. Baby new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when ya palm itch
I'm gon' get money money I'm gon' get
Young Money in ya tummy and we gon' shit
An get that toilet paper quick like when bones spit
That's right bitch I'm back on my grown shit
That automatic k no ice just chrome shit
And ya' boyfriend softer than a foam pit

Motherfucker I'm me, yeah bitch I'm me
You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down ya' entire street
So fly I'm a take off when I leap, bye
And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money headbutt Yao Ming
Putcha hand in the oven if ya' touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger jus screamin' mothafucker do you hear her
Drizzy Drake what the lick read?

Make some noise for Justin Bieber
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?

This ain't no fucking sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

20, keep the bar rolling
Fake IDs and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign

Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland 
Why? 'Cause

[Hook]
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made history

Tell them imma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Hook]
They loving the crew

[Outro]
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
So broadcast that, nigga we the news in the city
Baby I will not pout
Baby I will not cry
'Cause I've got your love this Christmas time
When the snow's on the ground
And it's freezing outside
I've got your love this Christmas

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
And warm me up with your Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of star can't be removed
Yea, and like a beautiful carol
I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
And warm me up with your Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

(For my very own Christmas love)
Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been around no press, ain't that serious

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been around no press, ain't that serious no

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

Can be, can be, be each other's company
Be each other's company
Just be each other's company
Be each others company

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
Then put your hands up... (Then put your hands up...)
(If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

Sean Don!
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title;
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walk out looking like a model...
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo,
On the moon - who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you... (got you...)
I got you...

Boy, you make me feel so lucky;
Finally the stars align...
Never has it been so easy
To be in love, and to give you this heart of mine...

You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be alright...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh...

And I'll never let you go...
You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

I get butterflies just thinking
About you - boy, you're on my mind...
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming,
Lost in your eyes, and I lose all track of time...

You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be alright...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you, oh...

And I'll never let you go...
You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

(What, okay, what...)
Now if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to public transportation?
Would you still be at home for me, with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too - you know I had some girls missionary;
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary,
And bible, I got it recycled - I love and I like you.
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru,
That's why I got you...

And I'll never let you go... (I got you.)
You should know I'm never gonna change; (I'm never gonna change...)
I'm always gonna stay... (I'm always gonna stay...)
When you call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there...), right there...
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it! I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
Got it, babe...
Little princess, summer flowers in her hair
Playing Ring Around The Rosie in the picture there
Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Colouring her lips red in her bedroom, yeah yeah

Prom queen, wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king, barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast

Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread
Climbing ladders, trying to get to the next step
Working hard, always wanting something more
Missing how things were simple like it was before

'Cause it's hard to know just what to do
When I still feel like a child in my mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast

Sometimes I wish I could just go back, and say
"Take your time and just let it last, little girl"

Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Little girl, don't grow up too fast, yeah yeah
<div class="lyricbox">Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Smoking on the beat, with my backpack on
And my snapback on, with the rap back on, uhuh
Beautiful girls wearing high heels
Asking how I feel, I feel I, uhuh

That’s when you walk by
I’m like damn you fly,
And I was like uhuh
You ask me where I’m from
And I say C-C-C-anada, uhuh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Uhuh, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah

Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Oh yeah

Oh the curves got me going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, uhuh
Let me ask you girl where your mind is
Let me just tell you’re the flyest, uhuh

Uhuh, uhuh, yeah

Say you'll never let me go, say you'll never let me go

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone

And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know
What that means, I know

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat

But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then, you'll never understand

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

We've turned our hands to guns
Trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you
Of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers
To my head

The solution is
I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest
And this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them
To turn their guns to a fist

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I shoulda never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Gotta figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you, I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so, personal
After all I tried to do, stay away from loving you
I'm broken-hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

All my life...
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low,
Dean on the low

I ask you what's the matter
You say, oh it's nothing at all
Heart's racing, outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go

You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive
Injured us fatally

You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I pray that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy (Marilyn Monroe)

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies, way above me
For you I've cried, tears sea-deep
Oh glory, the prayers carry me

I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever

I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other

Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever

I swear by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies, way above me
For you I've cried, tears sea-deep
Oh glory, the prayers carry me

I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever

I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other

Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment

'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
You know I hate sleepin' alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He don't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

It's like we at two places, but different paces;
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge...
It hurts, and feels discerning;
Did you forget where your heart lives?

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

(Let me show you how to get there.)
Take a left to compassion (lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there:
Affection... (You're in the wrong direction...)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care...

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home, (You said you would soon be home...)
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat... (Yo' sex ain't all that...)
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...) Let's go!

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

I'm taking back the things I got from you, you,
And that includes my sweet little nookie too, too...

Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Uh, uh, uh...
Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

[Rap:]
Rock diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records;
Since 16, I was coming down ridin' Lexus'.
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess;
You can call Tyrone - You ain't gots to lie, Craig!

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?
Acting like I'm nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He ain't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it.
[Sample from Notorious B.I.G. - Warning]
It's the one's that smoke blunts wit cha
See your picture, now they wanna grab they guns &amp; come &amp; get cha
*repeat*

Yeah
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already
I'm feeling **** in this bitch

[Verse 1] 
I'm so high even when I'm comin down 
Just met a girl said she from the H-Town, 
I said my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer 
Cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah 
Got these boppers goin crazy 
Nigga I'm the man 
I sent your girl message 
Said I see you when I can 
She send me one back 
But I ain't never read it
Cuz pussy's only pussy 
And I get it when i need it 
and I'm telling you I'm...

(I'm tellin you) I'm coldest, windows down in the winter 
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner 
Airports stunting flyin' charters over seas 
Full of Don Perignon and the water for the D's 
Don't know why it happens everytime we alone 
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone 
So ima sip this drink till' that motherfucker gone 
Then you go get undressed and we gon get it on 

[Verse 2] 
I don't give you the time you deserve from me 
This is something I know, I know, I know 
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston 
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow 
But I do it to her 

Draped up, dripped out know what I'm talkin bout 
3 in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot 
It's on once again and I never pretend 
A nigga stay G till' the end 

[Outro: Talking]
Ayy, Yeah
I swear like, everytime
I find myself in a situation
I just get that feelin like
I'm in Houston
Candy paint switchin colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m
And we just rollin through the city
Bumpin that screw
B.M.O
U.G.K
Lil keke
And I feel like
Everything just movin slow
I just take my time
I pace it baby
Yeah I'm gone ...
Yee-haw
Texas, Texas, Texas

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
'Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
(Good job Bey, hahaha)
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?
[Drake]
I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazin conversation with this girl named Lorraine
Who says shes from L.A.
Who keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Ooohhhh
She could be good for me (yeaaah)
This what you text me
Tell me that you miss me
I forget about Lorraine
And in fact shes right here with me
And shes starin at my face
Something had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away (yeahh)

I hate gettin messages from you (from you)
Its like you know the perfect shit to say

F-cks up my whole day
Thought that all these feelings went away

I hate gettin messages from you (from you)
Especially when you say you should've stayed
F-cks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away

I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back
I miss you too
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
You know alot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them, but
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'...

Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
You know I'll be over there
(Yup!) I'll be over there
Shorty, I'll be over there
I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'
I'll be there as soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waitin' room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused wit cause

Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time.

I say you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'...

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin'

Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had

Young money

When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back

Watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour
Got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas
Now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'ont know who we are
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shootin at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die I'm a mother fuckin legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup

You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
I need something strong tonight
I'm needing me 100-proof
Something to erase my mind
Rid me of the thought of you
Ain't gonna water it down when I say it out loud
I'm gonna mean it when I'm telling you goodbye
You're looking in my eyes but seeing somebody else
Yeah, I never should have fell

Yeah boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her,
It cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favours
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks, you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tyres 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her

Yeah, the grass ain't always greener 
Over on the other side
You never learn when you're a leaver
It's just a part of your design
'Cause you're the kind that can't stay for too long in a sad place
You'll be looking for me when you change your mind

Yeah boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her,
It cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favours
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks, you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tyres 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love of the game
It's the get what you want and then you throw it away
It's the rush of the fall, not the land
It's the catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favours tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tyres 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
[Gucci Mane]
I'm so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs,
There's a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby cos I romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
Theres nothing on the God son that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems, getting p-ssy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Man they like potato chips I just cant have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I dont like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cos you aint in the kitchen when you want a whipping,

[Drake - Chorus]
Uh, uh ahhhh,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just dont believe you,

Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How how (?) f-ck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree,
F-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas,

Girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to,
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

[Chorus]
[Sean Garrett]
Ain't that your girl,
Aint that your money,
Aint you the same n-gga that say she want you that you funny,
Aint you a gangsta, yeah funny,
You gave em funny, gave you to you, f-cking dummy,
Classic line, b-tches run like buses,
Gucci say n-ggas asking why, why you with my girl,
She let me get it n-gga,
She aint stupid, go turn up your radio,
I'm the next young Lionel Richie,
I gives a f-ck about doing a f-cking cameo,
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O's
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go

[Drake]
Uh UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
PROBLEM IS YOU PROL TELL THAT SH-T TO EVERYBODY,
SO WE HEAR YOU TALKING BOO BUT WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!!
<div class="lyricbox">Yesterday I got a call
Someone I didn’t know at all passed away
Mama said yeah you know him
You went to school with both his kids
They lived out on Prescott lane
She said you should’ve seen the line
Mrs. Johnson said to tell you hi

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes you go round
Thank God for the country lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won’t forget you
Cause when you’re lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah

Last June my cousin tied the knot,
Didn’t know if I’d go or not
But I’m sure glad I did
It was a pretty good haul but worth the drive
I could feel myself come back to life
The closer that I’d get
First red light I rolled the windows down
Breathed it in and took a look around

Thank God for hometowns
First kisses and touchdowns
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won’t forget you
And when you’re lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah

I always find another piece of me
Walking down these old familiar streets

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes them go round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won’t forget you
And when you’re lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Thank God for hometowns</div>
What goes around comes back around 
Hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around
I say, what goes around comes back around
What goes around comes back around

There was a time
I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been outta my mind

So when I think of the time that I
Almost loved you
You showed your ass and I
I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
So baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the
And I'm gon' always be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh, yeah
I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time
That I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And baby, yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad

'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Said, you turned out to be the
Hmm, and I'll never be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh baby, I bet
Sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one who's got away
Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God
I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
So through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)

(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
Let's go
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
I'ma tell you one time
One time

When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we goin' keep keep climbin' to the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt

'Cause girl you're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

You look so deep, you know that it humbles me
You by my side and troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt

'Cause girl you're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure

And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl

(girl I love, girl I love you)
<div class="lyricbox">Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, thumbing through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either</div>
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

I can pretend that I'm not lonely but
I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter but
I'll be sitting here lyin' to myself

Some say love ain't worth a buck but I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only
Been dreaming about

Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something
Fightin' for something
I know what you're fighting for
'Cause we all

We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it's cold
No one wants to be left scared and lonely

We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing

Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
Yeah, yeah, we all want love

I'm able to close my eyes yet my heart's not so blind
I feel so entitled, love owes me, I want what's mine

And some say love ain't worth a buck but I'll give my last dime
To have what I've only
Been dreaming about

Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something
Fightin' for something
I know what you're fighting for
'Cause we all

We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it's cold
No one wants to be left scared and lonely

We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing

Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
Yeah, yeah, we all want love
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love

But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it?

Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
[Drake - Verse 1]
Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it

Cap on, brim bent, Denzel every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cards saying fuck ya life

Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double

Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
But I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Drake - Chorus]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]
Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake

Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the peach state
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes

Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed

M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 though at the venue
Pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me

[Chorus]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

[Nicki Minaj]
I mean we don't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag
I mean, I mean but then again
Who looks at the price tag? You know.

[Drake]
Oh yeah, we in this bitch
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas

I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinion doesn't count
We the only thing that matters

So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night

Whole crews in here
'Cause I don't really know who imma lose this year
Man I love my team. Man I love my team.
I would die for these niggas
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
<div class="lyricbox">I'm going in, I'm ready to surrender
Like a diamond, I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
I’m burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

I'm restless, I'm craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Let's go all night, just you and me
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
I’m burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

I’m burning up, burning up, you’re right there
Your body heat right next to me
We're connected by the sun
And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame
And I don't care tonight
If it burns too bright
'Cause baby, that's why I came

All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
I’m burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat</div>
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We don't believe what's on T.V.
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want, we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

I need to know
That when I fail, you'll still be there
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling our hair

But I don't care what's in your hair
I just want to know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen
Would I just change what I told my friends?
Don't wanna know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

I need to know
That when I fail, you'll still be there
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling our hair

But I don't care what's in your hair
I just want to know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah
(repeat)
Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why

When the wind blows, and the sun goes away
And the sand fall, stormy day,
That's what it's for, yeah, that's what it's for, yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow yeah, jacket slow yeah

Whenever I do have it, do I ever want this to face me
Whenever I do have it, do I want this thing to make me
Cause the fame and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy (drive you crazy)
And all the "He said, she said", I'm thinking maybe
Just put on my...

Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why

But as I look around, I see
When I'm thinking never change me.
Well, all I gotta do is stay me
Let's the rest do the work and I'm sure that it'll be fine, be fine

When the wind blows, and the sun goes away
And the sand fall, stormy day,
That's what it's for, yeah, that's what it's for, yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow yeah, jacket slow yeah

Whenever I do have it, do I ever want this to face me
Whenever I do have it, do I want this thing to make me
Cause the fame and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy
And all the "He said, she said", I'm thinking maybe
Just put on my...

Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why

Turutu turutu turuturu (just put on my) [4x]
Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why
Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' PlayStation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check 'cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview

Justin
Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

Yeah, yeah
(I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it)

Rum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the Son
Playin' for the king, playin for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight, I might go psycho
Christmas time so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know I'm still young but I go I go
Stupid stupid love like cupid
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum
Busta Rhymes
Gather round the mistletoe real quick
Justin
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pa pum pum
Busta Rhymes
Matter of fact, let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in here
Justin
That's fit to give our king
Busta Rhymes
Bieber what up
Justin
Pa rum pa pum pum, pa rum pum, pa rum pum

Busta Rhymes
Lemme get straight to it. Yo
At the table with the family, havin' dinner
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
I said, "Cool." Ya know Imma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! "

Justin
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, pa pum pum, pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe

Globe globe globe globe globe
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
No no no no no no (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise
And who I am today is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
No no no no no no (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

You don't know my brain the way you know my name
You don't know my heart the way you know my face
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

My people singing

Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it, for others to use it
You're dead, 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?

Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common motivation
To promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment, but you and I know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh) My people singing

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
(I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you)
(Let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself)

Lookin' in your eyes
Makes me wonder how
I got so much time
With you and there's more around
I know all the competition after to you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

That we're living
In a fairytale, no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside you is only mine

That's how I know
I can't be your only one 
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't
I can't be your only one
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget it, yeah

As I'm laying down, with you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairytale, no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one 
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't
I can't be your only one
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't

(Only one)
(Be your only one)

Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to know and except yourself
And if you end up needing some extra help, then I can help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you payed me, now real nigga wassup
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before;
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more...
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be,
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point? No...

I don't care about it anymore, no,
I don't care about it anymore...
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me,
Used to have a hold on me, (Used to have a hold on me...)
Like what do you think? And what he thinks, and what they think,
But I love me, yeah...

I don't care about it anymore, no,
I don't care about it anymore...

I-I-I-I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah...
I-I-I-yea, yeah, ah, oh, I...
I-I-I-I ooh, ooh, ooh... oh...
I don't care about it anymore...
Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name, I'll never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Don't be afraid, close your eyes
Let me take you to places you've never been tonight
I thought by know you'd realize I can do anything I put my mind to

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
It's dead steady, there's falling and flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just stars, dance

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

I can make the stars dance
I can make, I can make, I can make the stars dance

The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you
<div class="lyricbox">It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you’re
Feeling brave
There’s so much power

In my name
If you pop off in your seat
Steady
I’m gonna do the wave

I’m such a
Fucking lady
You don’t have to be
So afraid

'Cause I got room
Up on my team
You can play
But hold up

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

It’s getting crowded
Over here
But babe
The wait is ova

Sometimes it takes
A thousand tries
To win
The wait is ova

Fumble
Don’t you fumble
That’s a flag on the play
Babe if you don’t wanna
Then you don’t have to wait
But together
We gon’ be taking over

It’s just the way
The game is played
It’s best if you just
Wait your turn

So you don’t wanna wait
I hate to hear
That’s such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways
Ain't no time out in my game
They already underway

I know you want to win
And you wish
I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play
But hold up

Wait your turn

Baby put the work in
Like a champion
But the crowd is screaming
With their hands way up
Couldn’t be with no one else
You’re the only way
I win

Baby got the whole world
Standing up
Damn I’m glad I picked ya
Took a chance on love
Baby love

The time is now
And now
The wait is ova

Daydreamer, sitting on the seat 
Soaking up the sun, he is a real lover
Making up the past
And feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
He's the subject of their talk 
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back
Oh

You can find him sitting on your doorstep 
Waiting for the surprise 
It will feel like he's been there for hours 
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt 
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be 
But he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you through 
There's no way I could describe him 
What I'll say is, just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sitting on my doorstep 
Waiting for the surprise 
He will feel like he's been there for hours 
And I can tell that he'll be there for life 
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world, where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shiney moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all are dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time
<div class="lyricbox">[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast

Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower

Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool

Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ll always be the one

One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife

That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Hook]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so [x5] proud of you [x3]

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you know who you are

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
...B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in

Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill

It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel, too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel, too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

H-h-h-he asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

[Hook]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so [x5] proud of you [x3]

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you know who you are

And all I can say is
I’m so [x5] proud of you (proud of you)
I'm so [x4]

It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so [x5] proud of you [x3]

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you know who you are</div>
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
I'm on fire
Take me higher
Than I've ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
To show you how

She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
I'm on fire
Take me higher
Than I've ever been


You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that's okay I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that's okay I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
I'm on fire
Take me higher
Than I've ever been

My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart
She's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I've ever been


My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart
She's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I've ever been
<div class="lyricbox">I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't want to be heard
I want to be listened to
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?

I scream, you scream
We all scream 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
‘Cause we don't want to lose our lives
So let's think of something better.

Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

My brain has given up
White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up on to the page
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?

I scream, you scream
We all scream 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
‘Cause we don't want to lose our lives
So let's think of something better.

Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward, torn
In to pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're suppose to be?
This is not what you're suppose to see
Please, remember me? I am suppose to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire
My treehouse is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned.

Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire</div>
Drake:
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Drake:
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Drake:
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Drake:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Rihanna:
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

Rihanna:
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Drake &amp; Rihanna:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Drake:
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

Drake &amp; Rihanna:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?

I don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought
Of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere
To make a better life
I hope that you find it
On the first try

And even though it kills me
That you have you go
I know that I'll be sadder
If you never hit the road, so

Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me

I will write to tell you
What's going on
But you won't miss nothing
But the same ol' song

If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend a day
Telling you stories
About a land far way

But I know you're going somewhere
To make a better life
I hope that you find it
On the first try

And even though it kills me
That you have you go
I know that I'll be sadder
If you never hit the road, so

Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here

Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me

And I'm gonna try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'm'a try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be
The reason you don't live

Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here

Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me

These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me 
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out 
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog 
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb 
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard 
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire 
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows 
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean rosé?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man</div>
Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away

Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence

You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

Tell me

'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where

Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where

'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Justin Bieber
As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me

Big Sean
Yo, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it, I'll fly you to it
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me
As long as you lo-lo-lo.. (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love me (that's all I want baby)
As long as you love, love, love, love me (please don't go)
As long as you love me

<div class="lyricbox">First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Missin' ya good intentions
Missin' ya from a distance
Hope ya did the same
I know that I caused a problem
I know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Sayin nothing gets you nowhere fast
I’mma hold it back inside

Well now that I'm back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error

It's time to do ya right wooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Goin' through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothin' in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That’s what they used to say
'Cause goin to sleep alone at night
I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holdin' back this time

Now that I’m back around ya
Nothin around me matters
Hope ya feel the same

Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery

Oooh baby how you doing? 
You know I'mma cut right to the chase 
Some women, were made 
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created 
For a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you, you feel me? 

It's on, baby let's get lost 
You don't need to call into work, 'cuz you the boss 
For real, want you to show me how you feel 
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal 

Why, well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets
You didn't know was inside,
No need for me to lie

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find 
On what I'm working with 
Damn I know, I'm killing you with them legs 
Better yet them thighs 
Matter a fact it's my smile 
Or maybe my eyes 
Boy you a sight to see 
Kind of something like me 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
I talk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
But he love my big ego 
It's too much 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I walk like this 
I, I talk like this 
I, I can back it up 
I can back it up 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talks like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walks like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 

Ego so big , you must admit 
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch 
Ego so strong, if you ain't know 
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
Feeling the remnants, got it in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain 
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants

You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready

I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control 
You haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Baby I'm not afraid to go the way 
But it's my first time and
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and
I'ma let you take the lead 
But it's my first time and
Baby I'm not afraid to go the way
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and 
I'ma let you take the lead
Remember it's my first time 

Arm in arm eye to eye 
As the music plays emotions rise
I think I'm ready
In your eyes I see three words 
Hold me tight cause I'm about burst
I think I'm ready

I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control 
You haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do 
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Baby I'm not afraid to go the way 
But it's my first time (it's my first time ahh ahh)
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and
I'ma let you take the lead 
But it's my first time (remember your first time ahh ahh)
And baby I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time and (it's my first time ahh ahh)

It felt like 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh

Just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to show me the light
Not just for the meanwhile
For a long long time, better believe it

Oh oh
Whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missin' my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
Till you're back again oh yeah yeah

You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missin' my lover

Got a whole lotta texts on my phone and I don't reply
The next eight bars tell you why

You're all that matters to me yeah yeah
Worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me yeah yeah

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team
To make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you

Oh oh
Grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You're all that matters to me yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me yeah yeah

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no I in team
To make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You're all that matters to me
Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood, it fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away 
And you just can't get it back let's face it

For one split second she almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops back into a cloud
So she took another step and said 
I see the way out and I'm gonna take it

I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted

Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain
He stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it

'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted

She kept driving along till the moon and the sun
Were floating side by side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted
(feat. Lil Wayne)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is east pot
That's why I'm ready, man
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie, man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah, they need ot issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamental are needed, you playin' street
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see ya'll
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Yep!

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chillin'
Super low key
If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.
All the hustlers and the bouncers
And the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, 50, 000's goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man
You actin' like a bitch
I ain't actin' like I'm rude
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich
Yeah, uh!
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?
'Cause I don't waste time, can't yo see a nigga lazy?
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?

[Spoken: Lil' Wayne]
Y.M., bitch!
Everybody!
Two time on Sunday!
Spit 'em!
Check ya blinkers, baby!
'Cause, to me, look like you've been turning right all day! Yeah!
Right my way! Ha ha!

That's right!
Cash Avenue!
Wall Street gangsta!
Carter, ya'll! Heh heh!

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
I'm feelin' like...
Damn!
I done walked in here
Straight up lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga
Ain't no nigga
Ain't no nigga like a young money nigga

Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right...

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
Justin Bieber
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
'Cause baby I didn't

Justin Bieber and Rascal Flatts
That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh (yeah)
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss (feeling your kiss)
That should be me, buyin' you gifts (buying you gifts)
This is so wrong, I can't go on (I can't go on)
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me (no)

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

That that should be me, holdin' your hand (holding your hand)
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad (this is so sad)
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm
It's getting harder to shield
This pain is my heart
Ooh ooh

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me (no)

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh (oh baby oh)
Giving you flowers
Talking for hours
I never should've let you go
That should be me (that should be me)
Oh baby
That should be me

And take a bitch from any nigga its what we do
So bite down hoe and get the right dentist

Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4

Drake:

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed

How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
25 sittin' on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, imma do it for the Bay

Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay."
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA

Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her

That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One... time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven... grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit

I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga money talks, and Mr. Ed

I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers

I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

Real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

Never woulda hitchhiked to Birmingham if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisiana if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda run through the blindin' rain without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in if it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind if it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me: I wouldn't be wishin' I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lyin' still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never woulda gone to that side of town if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda took a mind to track him down if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty-four and put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lyin' still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisiana if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four and put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
I am too easily blown away
And too easily lead astray
By a boy got that look in his eye
I get too stupid to run from the heat
Too dizzy to land on my feet
He's making the room spin
Dont know what i'm thinkin
Tonight
I'm dubbing headfirst into somethin
Better judgement's gone a runnin
Tonight, tonight

Nothing but trouble on his mind, 
I come across it all the time
Not getting smarter from it
Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this

E-e-easy completely, e-e-easy
He is selling me all the right stuff,
I'm sure that i cant get anough
That boy's got that look in his eyes
Well he has total control over me,
I'm falling right down at his feet
I'm drunk and i'm laughin,
Its making the room spin,
Tonight
I'm dubbing headfirst into somethin
Better judgement's gone a runnin
I'm headin straight into disaster
We all know what he is after
Tonight, tonight

Nothing but trouble on his mind, 
I come across it all the time
Not getting smarter from it
Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this
Kick myself for getting like this

E-e-easy, completely e-e-easy
Completely e-e-easy, completely e-e-easy, 
Completely e-e-easy, completely e-e-easy,
Completely e-e-easy, e-e-easy, 

Nothing but trouble on his mind, 
I come across it all the time
Not getting smarter from it
Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this

Kick myself for getting careless
Kick myself for feeling like this
The air begins to feel a little thin 
As I start the car, and then I begin 
To add the miles piled up behind me 
I barely feel a smile deep inside me 

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south 
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out 
But then I remember when you packed my car 
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart 
For me to drive away with 
I begin to understand why God died. 

The demons sat there waiting on her porch 
It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch 
And when my car was far out of sight 
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night 

And then I felt chills in my bones 
The breath I saw was not my own 
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame 
Wasn't made to play this game 
And then I saw Him, torch in hand 
He laid it out, what He had planned 
And then I said I'll take the grave 
Please just send them all my way 

I began to understand why God died 
The air begins to feel a little thin 
As we're waiting for the morning to begin 
But for now you told me to hold this jar 
And when I looked inside I saw it held your heart 
For me to walk away with 
I began to understand why God died
I told you once, get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright
But some things are better left unsaid

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands- )
(Put your hands up)

You tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid
Right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time 
Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well, I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Alright let's go
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh, oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh, oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe yeah
I just wanna set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely

There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl

(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
Only you shawty
Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type
But I can make you sway

It makes you burn to learn
You're not the only one
I'd let you be if you
Put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell
Where you end and I begin

It makes me burn to learn
You're with another man
I wonder if he's half
The lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else
Far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath
On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again
I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
<div class="lyricbox">Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
That shit ain’t my fault girl
Cause I'm lonely

Name another woman, ain't no other woman that should comfort me
When I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spend your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house
That you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun girl
But I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it I’m not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae

Name another woman, ain't no other woman that should comfort me
When I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

This shit ain’t my fault</div>
I never should of waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you til the final goodbye

Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its rewards, I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you til the final goodbye

Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Its you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you til the final goodbye
<div class="lyricbox">Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
When you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I stay by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that’s for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh lord

Where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
When you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I stay by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn’t open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith
Turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping

Tell me he, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn’t find you anywhere

Where you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I was by your side

So where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most</div>
Would of came back for you
I just needed time
To do what I have to do
Caught in a life
I can't let it go, whether that's right
I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and waited to long
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back...

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gay shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Bad
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains
The seats for these Heat games
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Would of came back for you
I just needed time
To do what I have to do
Caught in a life
I can't let it go, whether that's right
I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and I waited to long
But I woulda came back, woulda came back...
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives 
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her 

These days, when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied

You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her 
You shower me with words made of knives 

Time and time again I'll play the role of fools (just for you) 
Even in the daylight when you're dreaming (I'm close to you) 
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Even though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives 
<div class="lyricbox">Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't sorry

He trying to roll me up, I ain't picking up
Headed to the club, I ain't thinking 'bout you
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cup
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye
Tell him, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
No no, hell nah

Now you want to say you're sorry
Now you want to call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away, I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair</div>
Ooh, everybody's got a story

I'm calling out but no one's got the time
Didn't I tell you I was drifting?
Didn't I tell you I was slipping?
Oh, but no one's got the time
'Cause they're all looking for their answers
Looking for their signs
Looking for a little peace of mind
Give me something to believe in
Tell it to me with conviction
Make me feel like everything's alright
I can't stop this awful feeling
Something in me won't stop reeling
Make me feel like everything's alright
Inside I'm still somewhat learning
As the world keeps spinning round and round and round
'Cause we're all looking for the answers
Looking for the signs
Oh, I'm looking for a little peace of mind
Would you give me something to believe in
Tell it to me with conviction
Make me feel like everything's alright
I can't stop this awful feeling
Something in me won't stop reeling
Make me feel like everything's alright
Falling behind
Keep on falling behind
Throw me a line! (Throw me a line!)
Give me something to believe in
Tell it to me with conviction
Make me feel like everything's alright
I can't stop this awful feeling
Something in me won't stop reeling
Make me feel like everything's alright
<div class="lyricbox">It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

Word on the street's Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer flying thru the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Hey love, the wise men followed a star
The wise men followed a star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Aye love, don't you buy me nothing
Don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a Merry Merry Christmas

It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow, I know
But Ima be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Ima be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you (shawty with you)
With you, under the mistletoe
Under the mistletoe

Kiss me underneath the
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Kiss me underneath the
Kiss me under the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</div>
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my heart into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter what, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.
That's what it's....that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is.
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone

If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old time feeling, would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned

Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, your eyes
It's the end of the night
But the beginning of time, for you and I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day
Save the day
Save the day

Yeah we're still wide awake
Got me losing my mind, my mind
No, it's never too late,
Put your lips on mine
In the burning sunlight, I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day
Save the day
Save the day

Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah

Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, eyes, eyes

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day
Save the day
Save the day
Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm...
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me
(feat. Trey Songz)

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

[Drake:]
Nah,
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars
I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
That's my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies,
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a misses

[Trey Songz:]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house
Do you got somebody new in your life
Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Hook:]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO

I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop

[Trey Songz:]
Missin everything you say,
Missin all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this with out you here
Baby 07' supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Hook:]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't

I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

[Bridge:]
Wish I, Could wake up and forget about you
Not tryin to call you when I know I want to
(O wish I,) I gotta fight this feeling can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were apart of me

I love it when we're at a party
In a downtown crowd, oh
But I can hear you call me 'baby'
With the music up loud

Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far, 
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, 
A cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, 
Beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me 
And make me hold my breath

You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, what are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far,
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, 
Beating faster in your chest

And tonight I wanna drive so far,
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background underneath the hardest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank
That's where our hearts once save
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex 'til we got closure
Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it

And now my April shower you, forever and for me
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be a fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side
Keep growing closer throughout October
Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's eve
Then we'll be celebrating

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it
[verse 1]
Baby slow down just here me out
Theres something i gotta let you know
No need push no need to rush
You know you had me from hello

[hook 1]
When it comes to my heart i dont play
Baby boy cant you see the stop sign
Your movin much to fast
Baby love doesnt grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

[chorus]
Baby if your willing to wait

Before we take this very far show me who you really are

Oh, I'm not the one you know, you know

Is I am on the run and go

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Do do do do do do do do

Do

I am up against the wall, the wall
For, I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Do do do do do do do do

Do do do do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Cold nights under
Siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder
In one way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life

And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good

He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes

'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good

He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

And when I watch my baby grow up
I'll only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to my prayers
And that she'll say

He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should

He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

<div class="lyricbox">My life is a movie
And everyone’s watching
So let’s get to the good part
And passed all the non-sense

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I'll show you

I’ve got to learn things
Learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you

<div class="lyricbox">Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade,
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day,
One is for his wife,
The other for the woman who loved him at night,
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time.

And the preacher said he was a good man,
And his brother said he was a good friend,
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry,
Bye bye, bye bye

Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down,
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground,
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide,
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.

(Two black Cadillacs. Two black Cadillacs.)
Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone,
Turns out he been lying to both of them for oh so long,
They decided then,
He’d never get away with doing this to them,
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time.

And the preacher said he was a good man,
And his brother said he was a good friend,
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry,
Bye bye, bye bye

Yeah, yeah, they took turns laying a rose down,
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground,
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide,
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye,
Yeah, yeah.

(Two black Cadillacs)
It was the first and last time they saw each other face to face,
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away,
And left the secret at the grave.

And the preacher said he was a good man,
And his brother said he was a good friend,
But the women in the two black veils they didn’t bother to cry,
Bye bye, bye bye

Yeah, yeah, they took turns laying a rose down,
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground,
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide,
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye,

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Uh, when did you get like this
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me

[Chorus - Peter, Bjorn &amp; John]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

[Verse 2 - Drake]
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

[Chorus - Peter, Bjorn &amp; John]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

[Verse 3 - Drake]
Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But, I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You jus tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah

[Chorus - Peter, Bjorn &amp; John]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
(Intro)
To be or not to be - Not!
(Hol' up!) Bring the beat back.
(Stop!) I ain't ready yet.
(Wait!) Let me fix my hair... (Yes! Yes!)
Yes, ma'am... (Yes, ma'am...) 
Now pass me my dress. (Yes!)

I think I'm ready - Been locked up in the house way too long;
It's time to get it, 'cause once again, he's out doing wrong...
And my girls are so real, said it's been a minute since I had some;
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress;
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress!

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

Soon as he saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right;
Short and backless (backless, backless...), seein' my silhouette in the moonlight...
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice;
Little did he know - ha! - my man gon' take it off tonight...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress;
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress!

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

All the ladies, you ain't get all dressed up in your dresses,
and your best digs for no reason - Get ready to freakum, freakum!

When you put it on, it's an invitation;
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Yeah...)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it,
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

When you put it on, it's an invitation! (Hey!)
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Hey!)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it, (Hey!)
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
[Ooh, 'cause when he act wrong, hey!]
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song... [Get 'em uptight...]
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress; [Oh! Oh!]
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress! [Freakum dress...]

Ladies, looky here: when you been with your man for a long time (oh...),
Every now and then, you got to go in the back of that closet and pull out that freakum dress. (Oh...) Huh!
I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...) 
I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...)
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything we do
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
To hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Eerything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That is would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can spend the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago
Now, the night
Is coming to an end

The sun will rise
And we will try again

Stay alive
Stay alive for me
You will die
But now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure
To die

I will fear
The night again

I hope I'm not
My only friend

Stay alive
Stay alive for me
You will die
But now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure
To die
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby, take a chance or you'll never ever know

What ever we do, is between me and you

I've been a bad girl, daddy
Won't you come get me?

Give it to me like, I want it
This is for you, eyes on it
Roc me out, back and forth
Roc me out, on the floor

You know how to make, me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor, yeah

It's gonna be different tonight
The best time in your life

Baby take a peak at the girl I hide

I let you in on a dirty secret
I just wanna be loved

Give it to me like, I want it
This is for you, eyes on it
Roc me out, back and forth

Give it to me like, I need it
You know how to make, me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
<div class="lyricbox">She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings that you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

Hotel to hotel, girl -- I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend -- she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes -- don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit -- I put you back in yo place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone</div>
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Ooh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore
Here's how it goes
Boy meets girl, girl leaves boy
That's all I know
All I've done, all my life

'cause throughout my history
I've only been with jerks
Who couldn't take it
But you see the picket fence
A swing on the front porch with us two on it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'til now I've always been a quitter

You rescued me
Saved my life, just in time
Saw past all my issues and scars
And made me try

'cause, oh, the way you're kissing me makes it hard to breath
But I still like it
Oh, oh, it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly how I want it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'til now i've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'til now I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter
<div class="lyricbox">1st Verse:
On my roof
Dark and I’m burning a rose
I don’t need proof
I’m torn apart &amp; you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold Case Love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that’s enough

Hook:
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it’s over
It don’t make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

Chorus:
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures &amp; white outlines
Are all that’s left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

2nd Verse:
Should’ve investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn’t see (no)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain’t the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart’s no longer cold &amp; confined
I’ve had enough

Hook:
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it’s over
It don’t make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

Chorus:
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures &amp; white outlines
Are all that’s left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Bridge:
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I’ll never find the pieces of my heart
We’ve lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

Chorus: (2x)
Cold case love
And it got the best of us
and now prints, pictures &amp; white outlines
Are all that’s left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
and now prints, pictures &amp; white outlines
Are all that’s left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love</div>
When December comes, I bet you want to
Wrap me all up and take me home with you...
See what I look like under them lights;
We'll keep it quiet, whatever we do...

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime;

Guide you all the way down, be your nightlight,
Give you the sweetest kiss that you'll taste;
Unwrap me now - been waiting since midnight...

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime;
I'm just tryna to give you something to remember through the summertime...

And whatever is on your list, I'll do it;
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it... yeah...

I'm in my 14 carats, I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas, mmm
Now you say I got a touch, so good, so good
Make you never wanna leave, so don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

I'm on my Marquise diamonds, I'm a Marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm
You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave, I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I here, I know she feelin' for it through
And any time we get our boys in up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (whoo!)
Just made a bad miss without the ass shots (whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
[Chorus]
Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded, well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Hook]
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
Probably why Im back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Drake - Verse 1]
Tonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone, I, I, I, I, I'm with my people
I know you love it
I don't just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair Pinot Grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgements never clouded
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna f-ck with tinkerbell in never neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby after you
I've had a glass or too so

[Chorus]
Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one

Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Hook]
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Drake - Verse 2]
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I just put my bow tie
Millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just always say the cost of livin
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love i dont think should happen
Becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever n-gga, Diddy,

Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Hook]
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Uh....yea, alright. well alright. well alright. uhuh. yeah. .....feels good.

[Verse 1:]
It's a celebration, clap clap bravo,
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this...yea, and he was just practice.
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better,
And she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.

Ayo, ayo, ayo....[repeat 4x]
[Verse 2:]
This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder,
Clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl...and your mistakes are costin, girl...
And maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.
This is for them twentysomethin's: Time really moves fast, you were just 16...
This is for them thirtysomethin's that didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be...
This is for them fortysomethin's: Well, raise up yo' glass and laugh like a motherfucker!
This is for them fiftysomethin's: Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head...

Mom and Dad tried to hide the world, said the world's just too big for a little girl;
Eyes wide open, can't you see? I had my first heels by the age of 13!
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys - I swear, that just made 'em want me more;
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be - I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink!"

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna...
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters...

I'm a freak - all day, all night, ooh;
Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, all night;
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Schoolin' life... 
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) 

This is for them pretty somethin's livin' in the fast lane: See you when you crash, babe...
This is for them sexy somethin's: That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything...
This is for middle somethin's: Stop livin' in regret, baby, it's not over yet!
This is for them chipper somethin's that's high on life: Baby, put me on your flight!

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna...
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters...

I'm a freak - all day, a-a-all night, ooh;
Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night;
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Schoolin' life... 
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) 

I know it costs to be the boss - One day, you'll run the town;
For now, make your life what you decide - Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucker down!

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna... (Yeah...)
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters...

I'm a freak - all day, a-a-all night, ooh;
Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night; (Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy...)
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) 

There's not a real way to live this... for real;
Just remember to stay relentless... oh, yeah, oh, yeah..
Don't stop runnin' until it's finished... yeah, yeah, yeah...
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten... yay... ay... ay...
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (don't touch)

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

(Irreplaceable, irreplaceable)
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you? (nothing, no nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you... (I won't shed a tear...)
I won't lose a wink of sleep, 'cause the truth of the matter is 
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin', baby, hey hey

You must not know 'bout me
'Cause I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, nigga, pack all yo' bags, we finished
You must not know 'bout me, 'cause you made your bed, now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable
Oh, Miss Believer, my pretty sleeper
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
Inside your head
In the winter of dead

I will tell you I love you
But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears
My nose and feet are running as we start
To travel through snow
Together we go

We get colder
As we grow older
We will walk
So much slower

Oh, Miss Believer, my pretty weeper
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops
Please, take my hand, we're in for inland
As we travel through snow
Together we go

We get colder
As we grow older
We will walk
So much slower
You're set in stone and I never give in 
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening 
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that 
I think you're giving off way too much in fact 
I say we've only known each other one year 
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer my dear"

You like to be so close, I like to be alone 
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor 
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do 
But we do, but we do, but we do

I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more 
I've never known this inevitable 
You're the first to make out whenever we are two 
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you 
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative 
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combined 
You think we would and we do, but we do, but we do, but we do 

Favouritism ain't my thing but 
In this situation I'll be glad

Favouritism ain't my thing but
I'll be glad to make an exception

You're set in stone and I never give in 
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening 
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving off way too much in fact 
I say we've only known each other one year 
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer my dear"

You like to be so close, I like to be alone 
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor 
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
Cash money shit.
I can tell that money's got you working.
We've been talking for so long.

Now we're finally here in person.
I taste pain and regret in your sweat.
You've been waiting for me. Oh, ho.
I can tell that you've been practicing.

All those other men were practice.
They were practice. Yeah.
For me. For me. For me. For me.

Girl, you look good. Won't you back that ass up.
You're a fine motherfucker. Won't you back that ass up.
Call me 'Big Daddy.' Won't you back that ass up.
Girl, who is you playing with? Back that ass up

You're working with some ass. Yeah. You're bad. Yeah.
Girl, you're working with some ass. Yeah. You're bad. Yeah.
Make a nigga spend his cash. Yeah. His last. Yeah.

Hoes frown when you pass. Yeah. They're mad. Yeah.
Couple thousands on your bag. Yeah. Fuck yeah.
I'm a big timer nigga. Yeah. Money flipper. Yeah.
Get it understood. Yeah. It's all good. Yeah.

Girl, I know it's real
'Cause I've been around it.
You only want what's real.
You just never found it.

Don't give them no more chances.
Oh, girl, they had their turn.
Everything for a reason.
There's things you had to learn from them.

But when I get you to myself,
You know what's going down. What's going down.
Girl, you look good. Won't you back that ass up.
You're a fine motherfucker. Won't you back that ass up.

Call me 'Big Daddy.' Won't you back that ass up.
Girl, who is you playing with? Back that ass up
You're working with some ass. Yeah. You're bad. Yeah.
Girl, you're working with some ass. Yeah. You're bad. Yeah.

I know he messed up,
But let a real nigga make it right.
Let a real nigga make it right.
You deserve that much.

Let me put something in your life.

You're telling me it's only been

A couple other people that you've been with.
I'm a trust you. I'm a give you the
Benefit of the doubt.
And I'm a love you.

You can even call me 'Daddy.'
Give you someone to look up to.

After you. Back it up. Then, stop.

Baby girl, after you. Back it up. Then, stop
After you. Back it up. Then, stop.
I can tell that money's got you working.
That your body's so wet.

And we're finally here in person.
I taste pain and regret in your sweat.
You've been waiting for me. Oh, ho.
I can tell that you've been practicing.

All those other men were practice.
They were practice. Yeah.
For me. For me. For me. For me.
She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for
And she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
She can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this live
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Why can I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see, how good this can be
I hope she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side
Cause she gets the light that is in me
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
<div class="lyricbox">Don’t do it to me
Don’t do it to me
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no

Focused, I’m focused
She got a body like that
I ain’t never seen nothing like that
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That’s right I think she foreign
Think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon’ work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
And I’m down with it
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It’s not hard to notice, that I’m open
Hypnotized by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
And I’m down with it
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

Still I gotta have it
Oh no no, oh no no
But still I gotta have it</div>
I'm taking over my body
Back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
"T"s uncrossed and "I"s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot
Like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, swat

I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

And I'll be holding on to you

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me"

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith



Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

And I'll be holding on to you



I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift
I see you doin' well, baby
Oh you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....

Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right, but that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
We were so close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me, the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know, baby
Almost, baby, is never enough, baby
You know

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (is never enough, babe)
We were so close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you (babe)
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know, baby
Almost is never enough baby
You know

E, e, everybody know that face.
Even with her head low, they still know that shape.
When she come through the club people take they place.
Chicks throwin handcuffs 
'cause they knowin they man aint safe.

'cause she the one switchin up flows.
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me"

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith



Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

And I'll be holding on to you



When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na 
Na na na na

When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na 
Na na na na

When you're ready

When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na 

You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sittin' right here, real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waitin' standby
Can't stop because I love it, hate the way I love you
All day, all night, maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie

I'm not too shy to show I love you, I got no regrets
I love you much, too much to hide you, this love ain't finished yet
This love ain't finished yet

You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that
And baby once I get it, I'm yours, no take backs
I'm gon' love you for life, I ain't leaving your side
Even if you knock it, ain't no way to stop it
Forever you're mine, baby I'm addicted, no lie, no lie

I'm not too shy to show I love you, I got no regrets.
So baby whenever you're ready

When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na

When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na

Because you love me so

Na na na na 
Na na na na

When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na 
Na na na na

When you're ready

When you're ready, come and get it
Na na na na 
Na na na na
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We kept each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)

Woahoooo (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors of the wild

We are survivors (woah)
We are survivors (we are survivors)
Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too

You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette

Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye

Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am
Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin homie (Aye)
Look

[Chorus]
I aint never been nothin but a underdog
And I aint gonna neva let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

Just copped new shoes
Whip on two twos
Dick down you two
Throw it on youtube
Tell me what youd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal
Stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta Manana though
Hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it aint a city I aint never been
Scared I aint never been
Yea I aint never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under yall
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwears
Still in the hood yeah
I aint talking outer wear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cuz I'm with it
F**k yall the underdog

[Chorus x1]
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it aint a Buick
I never redezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the f**k you want to do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I f**k with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drive it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia
And coppertone
And girl I heard your man's a fed
Don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Aint one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city
Got it mobile like the lock is gone
Keys out
I aint talking white though
Baby what you be's bout
I mean for tonight ho
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

[Chorus x1]
Teach You A Lesson (Remix) Lyrics
Robin Thicke Ft. Drake

[Drake]
Me and you so crucial, baby
and that champagne, so fuchsia, baby
I do things that you ain't used to, baby
I take ya back home and sing Lose Ya, baby
When raindrops hit the tin roof, it's crazy
that's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
Well you all wet, covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like, Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to you if you need that
touch right there, whatever the speeds at
if it's over fast then, then I promise you a relapse
forget what you guessin' I'm on
and who was in your past, I'm fresh n' I grown
just charge that cell that I message you on
and if you let us girl, I'ma bring the dresser along
hear that professional tone, half of that's ice and the rest Patron
show up on time for the class that I'm teaching
cuz guaranteed, I'ma bring a lesson along
and you just gotta bring ya breasts along
instead of holdin' out, wonderin what it coulda been
I confess, this addressed to you
and I'm the postman, looking for a slot I can put it in
with no New York number, mom still upstairs I'm two floors under
but my room soundproof,  you so tempted
to satisfy your urge, so you don't wonder,
yeah, I know I told ya before
I grab that for ya like holdin' the door
cuz mines is Polo and yours is Vicky, and they just spread all over the floor like...

[Robin Thicke]
U feel so good
U smell so good
U feel so warm
Just like I knew u would
I can't let u go

U were late 2 school
I'm gonna have to, see u after class
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have 2 teach u a lesson
Someones gonna have 2 straighten u right out
Someones gonna have 2 teach u
Teach u teach u teach u

You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
you wont get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
you can work it off
Baby I can give you, extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
You were late 2 school
Teach u teach u teach u
Girl can I frisk you?
Search your body for,
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause you're hiding WMDs
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let u go

You were late 2 school
I'm gonna have 2 see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
Someones gonna have to straighten you right out
Someones gonna have to teach u
Teach u teach u teach u

For the moment, for tonight
can I make you mine?
Is it me? is it us?
Can I love you all my life?
[Chorus:]
Look,
If You A Girl With The Aspirations
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin
I Ask You To Have Some Patience
(You're Worth So Much More)
To My Dudes At The Bar With A Freak And
Steady Lightin Cigars At The Parties They Sneak In
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz

[Verse 1: Drake]
Im From The City Where People Be Gettin Lazy
Litterin In The Streets
And The Club District Is Poppin Like Literally Every Week
And Promoters'll Push Flyers
Money Exchange Hands
Liars Sell You They Dreams
And Dummies Exchange Plans
Hustlers Give You Events
Bouncers Give You Pass
Directors Give Em A Shot
So Girls'll Give Up The Ass

And Groupies That Would Flock To Hometown Athletes
And Start Rolling Together Like Snoopy And Woodstock
Daffy And Bugs, Its All Laughing And Hugs
Til The Dude Catch A Plane
And She Back Where She Was
Right Back On The Bus
Its Ashame Cuz Now At His Rental
She Throwin Bricks Like Shaq In The Clutch
You Can See Thats Shes Colder
Cuz He Doesnt Hold Her
Fall Flat On The Ground Trying Ta Lean On His Shoulder
Know That He Tried Ta Told Her
That He Couldnt Mold Her
If This The Type Of Chick You Wanna Be When You Older, I Say

[Chorus:]
If You A Girl With The Aspirations
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now Up North Theres Five Artists Deservin A Listen
And Im One Of Em, The Other Four You Know Who You Are
But If You Gotta Think Through
Chances Are That It Aint You
I Singlehandedly Carry Out What You Cant Do
And See I Take A Couple Of Breathers
And Then Things Come Together On The Spot Like A Couple Thats Eager
If You Wanna Pack A Duffel And Leave Her
Go Ahead, I Couldnt Give Two Damns Like A Couple Of Beavers
But Uh, The In &amp; The Out
[?]
Whenever Im Out In Memphis The Man Seen As Trill
And Every Verse The Man Seem To Kill
You Can Find Him With Black Jays And Socks Like Im Andreena Mill
Japan And Brazil, The Audience Acreaming
And Then You Come Around And All The Fans Seems To Chill
Advances To Deals, Financing Appeals
The Hustles, I Have You Feeling Like You Dancing In Heels And Uh

[Chorus:]
If You A Girl With The Aspirations

Man it feel like rolling dice, man it feel like rolling dice
Seven eleven, seven eleven, seven twice, man seven twice

Ooh we be be freaky deaky
Think me see she pink bikini
Rock out that booty
Sweating on my blow out
Sweating on my dress
This trick about to go off
Mad cause I'm so fresh
Fresher than you
I'm fresher than you
Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore
Just when you think it's lost in the rain
It comes back knocking at your door

It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around

God put us here on this carnival ride
We close our eyes
Never knowing where it will take us next
Babies are born and at the same time, 
Someone's taking their last breath

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around

In the blink of an eye
It can change your life
And it never even slows down

It's the wheel of the world
I don't know what it is
I'm flying high
Then I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
Life keeps on moving anyway

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
It's the wheel of the world turning around

It can open your heart
It can break you apart
And it never even slows down

It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
I feel weak - we been here before,
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth...
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through,
But I honestly can say I still love you...

Maybe we reached the mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece, and we're both too blind to find...

Let's start over - let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - stop fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over - we can't let our good love die;
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life...

I can see that we're not happy here,
So why would we keep pretending, when there's nothin' there?
Maybe you like it - well, I don't;
Maybe you settle - well, I won't!

Maybe we reached the mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost that magic piece, and we're both too blind to find...

Let's start over - let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - stop fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over - we can't let our good love die;
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life...

I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry;
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie...
I feel I know what's best for us;
Let's... 

Start over, and let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over, yeah... We both know that this love won't die;
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life...
I'm in this fight, and I'm swinging
And my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I tried to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

Chorus:
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared of the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
In this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you, I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness
I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)
Now I let you out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

Thought I couldn't breathe without you
I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you
But I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here
Even in my years to come
I'm still gon be here

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm wishin' you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon blast you on the radio
I'm not gon lie on you and your family, yo
I'm not gon hate on you in the magazines
('m better than that)
I'm not gon compromise my Christianity
(I'm better than that)
You know I'm not gon dis you on the internet
Cause my mama taught me better than that

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gonna work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gonna work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

(Beyonce and Michelle)
Oh (oh) oh (oh)...
After of all of the darkness and sadness
Soon comes happiness
If I surround my self with positive things
I'll gain prosperity

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl
Oh man I don't know
Pilled up filled up damn girl
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man
Laced up dripped up sauced up
Damn girl I wanna ride with you
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up
Had to get it popping with you

What if I pick you up from your house
We should get out
We haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go
You know that I did
I don't know if you know but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well he'll understand
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna I'll say it again
Soon as you get in nah nah nah

Breathe through, ride through, damn girl
Oh man I don't know
Pilled up filled up damn girl
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man
Laced up dripped up sauced up
Damn girl I wanna ride with you
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up
Had to get it popping with you
I wanna fall inside your ghost 
And fill up every hole inside my mind 
And I want everyone to know 
That I am half a soul 
Divided 

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away 
Either way you're by my side until my dying days 
And if I'm not there and I'm far away 
I said, "Don't be afraid." 
We're going home. 

I wanna strip myself of breath 
A breathless beast of death I've made for you 
A mortal writing piece of song 
Will help me carry on 
But these you heard 

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away 
Either way you're by my side until my dying days 
And if I'm not there and I'm far away 
I said, "Don't be afraid." 
We're going home. 

So the hearse ran out of gas 
A passenger purse and grabbed a map 
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past 
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab 
A beautifully planned taxi cab 
A cab, had it cleared out back 
And two men started to unpack 

Driving once again 
But now this time there were three men 
And then I heard one of them say 
"I know the night will turn to gray 
I know the stars will start to fade 
When all the darkness fades away 
We had to steal him from his fate 
So he could see another day 

Then I cracked open my box 
Someone must have picked the lock 
A little light revealed the spot 
Where my fingernails had fought 
Then I pushed it open more, 
Pushing up against the door 
Then I sat up off the floor 
And found the brother we're searching for 

Then there were three men up front 
All I saw were backs of heads 
And then I asked them am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead 
And then one turned around to say, 
"We're driving toward the morning sun 
Where all your blood is washed away 
And all you did will be undone." 

I said, "Don't be afraid."
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breath
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has it's scars

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy

No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be...
Your Remedy
Didn't I give it all, tried my best?
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here

But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily, I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is for you

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Yeah
Check

Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
It is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snappin 
And they try to make you out as a lie
Symbolic cuz you were just trying to please em' by using logic and reason
It's a lose/lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected 
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
To try and make em a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first 
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourselves 'stead of claimin' you couldn't help
And maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus:
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try, Try-Try-Try

And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spittin' the pressure
Than most of the rappers running the game
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit to cash 
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a range also got me a guilty conscience 
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran
Sometimes I wish that I woulda just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers 
Cuz I'm really telling me what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time 
I wasted late out at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I working hard on the winner
So this album is a labour of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
Then she can rest without a toss or a turn
Cuz she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned 
But I'm gonna try to..

Try harder cuz
Try, Try-Try-Try
I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours boy
The way your body moves across the floor
You got me feelin' n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

Baby the minute I feel your energy
The vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

I love to love you baby

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Repeat to end]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Wohh ho ho oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Wohh oh oh oh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Wohh ho ho oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat

This whiskey got me Feelin pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry about the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

You take me higher
Higher than I've ever been babe
Just come over let's pour a drink babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late
Too late
You're like my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a jay
I wanna go back to the old ways
But I'm drunk instead with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say
It's a holiday (yeah, yeah yeah)

Spend it with you baby
I think that I'm in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace
You know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh ride now
So today is all about you baby
The mistletoe can pull us close
That's what I'm waiting for
It sort of feels like it's Valentines, Valentines
So I land on top of your roof
Them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you
Them carols are singing
Japan to Peru
Baby me and you
This Christmas Eve

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday my dream
Lay your head on me
I got you babe whoa
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

You leave some cookies out
Imma eat em all
Nobody can see me but you
It's so magical
When we use imagination
We can fly to Never Never Land
The North Pole ain't that cold
If you wanna go
I got you baby

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday my dream
Lay your head on me
I got you babe whoa
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this Christmas Eve

Be my, be my Christmas Eve

B-B-B-Be, be, be
B-B-B-Be
Wooooahhhh  yayyyy  oohhh

Baby please we don't have to explain the reasons
This is me I know your mind can change like the seasons
Go your way I know the world is calling your name boy
It's okay cause what we got it ain't gonna change boy

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're loosing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

You and me we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying to hard to play cool
I don't mind I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time sometimes the heart rearranges

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're loosing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

Oohhh heyyay
There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there'right there

When your friends start to trip and you're loosing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothin' 
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man

Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep

I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell these story I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?

Sold it dirty like Diana never clean
My ex ask me where I'm moving I said "On to better things"

10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo in a week now

10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep

I been on a mission haven't left the condo
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
Yeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri
All I need is love
That's what you give, I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That's what I feel when your skin's on mine

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you

All I need is true
That's what you are
When everything's alright
All I need is here
Right where you are, you're every reason why

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better
Raekwon
Visual visual JB
Yo Ye whattup
Raekwon

You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta

Justin Bieber
You see my baby over here
Hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
What you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Kanye West
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine

Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I (oh I) I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah)

Raekwon
Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this b*tch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh baby
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
<div class="lyricbox">[Intro: Drake talking]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-trãn had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
'Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
'Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Fillipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it 'cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table 
And say "my baby's famous and I knooow it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' tooo it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video 
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
For too many rappers and not enough __
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my (Craig David) shit the (Artful Dodger)
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

[Chorus]</div>
<div class="lyricbox">Red sun, saltwater dripping haze
Stick-shift, summer Sahara chains
We ain't alone

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Look for the golden sombrero, Puerto Nuevo west
Blondes have a little too much fun, I'll be brunette
Adiós 'til then

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Run, run, run
Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Crossing that border; passport says Jane Doe
For a little while, baby, just lay low
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico
Suntan, seaside, feeling that breeze blow
We'll be sipping that smooth Don Julio
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico, yeah</div>
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I close my eyes, I take it slow. 
Lay on down and let me rest my soul. 
I've been so high, I've been so low. 
I'm just tryna find my way back home. 
Can't help but roam. 
My signal's gone. 
Guess this journey's left me on my own. 
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone. 

And if I could. 
Forget about the way you love me. 
Forget about the world, we're set in stone. 
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now. 
If only I could hit the ground 
I never thought that I'd be broken 
I never thought I'd be this far from home. 
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now. 
If only I could hit the ground. 

I close my eyes, I take it slow. 
Lay on down and let me rest my soul. 
I've been so high, I've been so low. 
I'm just tryna find my way back home. 
Can't help but roam. 
My signal's gone. 
Guess this journey's left me on my own. 
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone. 

And if I could. 
Forget about the way you love me. 
Forget about the world, we're set in stone. 
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now. 
If only I could hit the ground. 
I never thought that I'd be broken. 
I never thought I'd be this far from home. 
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now. 
If only I could hit the ground. 

Take it one day at a time. 
Reach for the stars now. 
Ooh just leave the past behind. 
It's a part of living. 

If only I could hit the ground. 
If only I could. 
I could hit the ground, right now. 
If I could hit the ground. 
Then I'd be falling down. 
If only I could hit the ground. 
If I could hit the ground. 
Then I'd be touching down. 
If only I could hit the ground.

Come a little closer. Let me whisper in your ear

Move in real close so we can celebrate 
The way we feel about eachother's loving (Want to tell you words....)</div>
One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah
Justin Bieber
Oh whoa

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Ludacris
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Justin Bieber
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
I'm gone
I was sitting on my doorstep
Hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand

So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make

Chorus:
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get on to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you're trying to fly
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead just waiting for me
But getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bittersweet

(Repeat chorus)
Time heals the wounds you feel somehow
But right now

(Repeat chorus)
Uh, I am a distraction,
Comin' from my spot and I dont signal as I back in.
If cash is beautiful and money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold to Maxim.
Open to my page and admire my desire,
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire,
My voice stands alone even if I'm with the choir,
Got a cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.
Nah, this the record killer for hire.
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require,
Look what I created despite the niggas that hated, 
Every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.
The me and bitch the same we feeling so related,
Forest Hill estated or Dennis Caded
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.
So wait just take this,

One line at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, nigga haha
Yeah, I wrote this verse sittin in my new car,
Sometimes where you headed is too far,
It's more about where you are.
And I am everywhere that you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up,
I'm at the label in the elevator,
Send them up

(Intro)
To be or not to be - Not!
(Hol' up!) Bring the beat back.
(Stop!) I ain't ready yet.
(Wait!) Let me fix my hair... (Yes! Yes!)
Yes, ma'am... (Yes, ma'am...) 
Now pass me my dress. (Yes!)

I think I'm ready - Been locked up in the house way too long;
It's time to get it, 'cause once again, he's out doing wrong...
And my girls are so real, said it's been a minute since I had some;
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress;
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress!

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

Soon as he saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right;
Short and backless (backless, backless...), seein' my silhouette in the moonlight...
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice;
Little did he know - ha! - my man gon' take it off tonight...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress;
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress!

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

All the ladies, you ain't get all dressed up in your dresses,
and your best digs for no reason - Get ready to freakum, freakum!

When you put it on, it's an invitation;
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Yeah...)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it,
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

When you put it on, it's an invitation! (Hey!)
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Hey!)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it, (Hey!)
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
[Ooh, 'cause when he act wrong, hey!]
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song... [Get 'em uptight...]
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress; [Oh! Oh!]
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress! [Freakum dress...]

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

Ladies, looky here: when you been with your man for a long time (oh...),
Every now and then, you got to go in the back of that closet and pull out that freakum dress. (Oh...) Huh!
I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...) 
I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...)
Now that I have captured your attention
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. T say I'm ready for inspection
Show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
No stop until the morning
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah
Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
No stop until the morning
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from;
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun...
My jacket don't get no love, no hats and no gloves, not even a chance of rain,
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things...

Hey-yo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole,
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday made just for me and my baby...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...)
My baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown, (No, no, no, downtown...)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out... (Oh...)
Ain't no ice or no chills, no snowmen to build - most of our friends at the beach,
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...

Hey-yo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole,
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday made just for me and my baby...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...)
My baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...

Just imagine that we're laughing in our cabin, chilling by the fireside;
Even though this sun is blasting, we can be wherever if we visualize...

Hey-yo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole,
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday made just for me and my baby...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...)
My baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things, hey, yeah...
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

I was out shopping, thinking of something I should get you
'Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend

Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my baby

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Oh, boy, if you just call, I'm on my way

It's just you and me all night
Don't worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight

Don't worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you
I model sexy pictures right on top of you
Ten years together still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high school sneaking with my boyfriend

Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my baby

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
Well I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're where I wanna be

Just let me look at you
Ooh, you look so sexy, boy
I wanna taste
You already know which way
When I groove with you
You feel so good, boy, you're my favorite place
Just come and lay under me

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight

You ain't got to worry 'bout a club

You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight

You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Verse 1: Drake) 
My name is drizzy 
And I aint perfect 
And I work hard 
So I deserve it 
And I belong 
Right where you see me 
Aint on the fence about it 
I aint mister fenny 
I go a decent set of manners 
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner 
And I fall in love with girl 
Caugh up and superficial glammer 
Who dress like sara jessica 
And live like princess diana 
So often they have addiction 
And im the one who will feed it 
But truly you bad enough 
Where you don't really even need it 
You could show up to the party 
On dirty public transit 
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids 
Of you and your possie partying 
Drinking what you get handed 
With your virgin island tans 
All looking like you just landed 
I don't really understand it 
Im not sure im comprehending 
Cause these girls are having fun with who money they spending screaming 

(Chorus (2x)) 
I Got To Be Unstoppable (2x) 
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Like (2x) 

(Verse 2: Lil Wayne) 
My name is whezzy 
Im almost perfect 
And I work harder than hard working 
Bizarre circus 
That's what my bars surface 
There far I act a clown 
Even when I laying on my back im never backing down 
So over stand me 
I got a condo in miami 
And my door mat is always sandy 
And I run louisiana 
But I never pulled a hemi 
And I got a condo in atlanta 
And I always wear a bandany 
And when it come down to stunning 
You boys are just fronting 
And I swaging for the fence 
Your girl hanging from my dick 
Your girl singing to my shit like 
A li li lollipop 
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop 
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist 
Hold this 
Text me whenever you want some more dick 
More dick 
Old bitch 
Young bitch 
But I be like damn 
All I got is one dick 

(Chorus (2x)) 
I Got To Be Unstoppable (2x) 
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Like (2x)
<div class="lyricbox">[Drake]
I said tell me what's really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I’m ready, what's happening
Gon for surgery but now I’m back again
I’m bout my paper like a muthfucking scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice

[Bun B]
Drake you got em right?

[Drake]
Yeah, I got em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ’s got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I’m in the city of the purple sprite
Someone tell Maliah I’m on fire she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell China it’d be worth the flight
I’ll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twirk something basis
She just try'na make it so she right here gettin naked
I don’t judge her, I don’t judge her
But I could never love her cause to her I’m just a rapper
And soon she’ll have met another
Thats why me and Lil' Jazz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I’m just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj
I told her I’d admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I’m fucking serious I’m with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the cameras always rollin’
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin’
Cause it’s on...

[Chorus]
Yeah girl it’s on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I’m gone
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I’m gone
And you just tell me what you down for
Anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Lil Wayne]
Oooh shit,
Muthafucker god damn
Kicking bitches out the Condo like Pam
Getting money everyday I’ma ground hog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don’t piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off
Erghhhh, thats nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make em run and tell your friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money Jerry Sloan
I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that’s how she learn every song
To the women I condone better write me when I’m gone
No I’m not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uhh, I’m a love machine
And I wont work for nobody but you
It’s only me and her cause the Bugatti coupe
Its blood gang slam but I party with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot
You don’t need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lining soup
And when I’m in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles, I am a group
Damn, I’ll be gone till November
But fuck it I ain't trippin, I know Drizzy gon’ kill em’
I’m sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama say it if the rules ain't bent don’t bend 'em
Real nigga talking
Shut the fuck up hoe
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, wattup Zoe
Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do’
Cause that’s where I bring it,
Soo wo if you banging, mothafucka

[Chorus - Drake]
Yeah girl it’s on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I’m gone
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I’m gone
And you just tell me what you down for
Anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone</div>

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
So then I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damn
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
Is why I gotta ask... 

is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn
I cant even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
This why I gotta ask, 

is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new 

Is anything I'm doing brand (new(6x))
Or is everything I'm doing too (late(6x))

Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?

is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Show me if this is brand new?

yeah, yeah yeah...
Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
He's wrong, she's right
No kiss goodnight

Ring ring, telephone
Act like I'm not home
Can't hear the tears cry
On the other end of the line

And the minutes turn to hours
And they're flying like a jet plane
And we'll make it right tomorrow
But tomorrow's not a sure thing

The clock don't stop ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't stop ticking away, away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't stop ticking away
It's ticking away

Head's scared, heart broke
Burned from a band of gold
Rather just be alone
Was just a bad joke

Bang bang on a drum
You're not a setting sun
You ain't even close to done
Run baby, run run

The clock don't stop ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't stop ticking away, away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't stop ticking away
It's ticking away, yeah, yeah, yeah

Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
I'm wrong, you're right
Kiss me goodnight

The clock don't stop ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait

You're telling me you're sorry, well, sorry, my friend,
'Cause I've already been there, done that, ain't doing this again... no...

(feat. Trey Songz)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor, tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO, D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again, return of the mack again
"Deceiving" was cool, I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin one of my rappa friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' you know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me... little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best decisions you've made
I'm sunnin' them all, I live in the shade
Previously mischievious behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited to degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, kinda adult shit
I am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall
With friends that I ball with
Hear me: Trey's girl go and get me some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise, I will kill this song til it actually dies
With military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best til the stats arrive
At all these a-list parties you fratranize
Where you can't wear hats inside only slacks and ties
Bu you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best

[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz - rap]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yep it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exibitor
Play me I'll visit ya, lay ya in critical condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin with a fly face, slim face, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos, now we got the city froze
Somethin like my wrist be, niggas know how dis shit be
Step to the club, security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor, dey give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy, straight no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patron to the face til he wasted
I'm blowin til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
All me Mister Anderson huh I'm ramblin
But at the same time, I'm spittin a flame rhyme
Baby what's you're name, hey call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's gametime
We could take a couple shots, break down ya d'z
Take it to the hole, post up on me
Let me feel the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 3:]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Fresh up on the scene
Big blunt full of green
Fitted to the back, 'Ginia be on the map
Virginia on the back of the hat while I mack
Ay shawty you phat and I love that
Big stage, and I holla "where dem thugs at? "
Fellaz hit me and they holla "where the drugs at? "
I'm a charge a nigga fifty for the a dub sack
Fuck v.I.p. cus the bithes all ova a nigga
And the weed all ova he liquor
I mean the liquor all over the weed
Shit, a nigga all ova da B
And the flames all ova da feez
And I be all ova da streets
I'm on my grind, come go with a G
Gettin money ain't nuthin to me babae
Say no, and you frontin to me
I'm a give ya what you want it to be
When I give ya what I give ya

[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice
Behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you

Won't you stay alive?
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely

Won't you stay alive?
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely

Your redemption won't grow stale
We are now just setting sail
On the seas of what we fear
Treason now is growing near to me

I'm coming clean
God, hit me straight on

Won't you stay alive?
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely

Won't you stay alive?
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely

(You say things with your mouth)
(Cobwebs and flies come out)
(I hear a second voice)
(Behind your tongue somehow)
(Luckily I can read your mind)

Don't be gone

You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I 'm special
Cover me with sweetness
Cause the time will come when we're not so young and beautiful

While we're young and beautiful
Livin' free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancin' in our barefeet
Cause when the summer's done
We might not be so young and beautiful

Chorus:
It's a crazy ride, baby you and I
Are keepin' our sweet love alive tonight
While we're young and beautiful

We'll party down on main street
Wearing next to nothin'
Feelin' every heartbeat
Having fun
While we're still young and beautiful

(Repeat chorus)
Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful

(Repeat chorus)
Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We hot right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Baby tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever baby I'm yours

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

So close I can taste you
Ain't escape I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Can you feel me
You got me feel it

Something you wanted to do what you like
There's no more waiting tonight is the night
And we can't be wrong not if it feels this right
Turn it up, scream it loud
But we got right now

Tomorrow's way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Cindy she's the one to watch out for.
Look at her on the
Dance floor, feeling so at ease.
*There are 37 boys on her
left side I wonder who'll get the free ride, she's
Easy as can be.*

Cindy she's something of a
Disaster and nothing ever gets past her.
Watch her as she
Walks by.
Air thick cigarette smoke I was choking and some
body spoke she was laughing, and I dont Think I really want to
Know why no no.

I'm tryin' to do it all tonight,
I got plans,
I got a certain lust for life,
And as it stands,
Everything is going as right,
As it can,
They tryin' to shoot down my flight,
Before it lands,
Before it lands

But you could miss me with all that,
Diss me then crawl back,
I really wish ya'll would fall back,
But gettin' rich suppose to solve that,
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say,
No no no,
My ex sendin' late night text cause she dont know how to let,
Go go go

Uh, 
She in love
And as for the pretty light skinned models standin' in the cold ah yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Every time that I'm here but when am I really even here?

Black surburban wit' the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'ma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Mars yellow tux
I don't really give a fuck
And we only getting older
So what I tend to do is to think, 
Of today, as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, 
But you hope, that you last
You just hope,
that it last (echoes 5x)
...

Throw your ones up in the air,
Throw your ones up in the air for her,
Oh oh, throw your ones up in the air,
Throw your ones up...
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...

Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love me
But I guess I guess I guess it's all good
You can play the game, imma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for hurt to be good 

When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering
Why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around
I ain't got all day

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered,
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Riding, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

If you want it let's do it
Riding, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...
Think I give a damn, boy don't you know who I am?
I don't run around kissing no dude
If somebody else like me don't come around
Boy you got it misunderstood

Put it in your face but you recognize yet
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance
Tell me what it's gon' be?

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered,
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Riding, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

If you want it let's do it
Riding, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...
You say it's my fault, okay I get it
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it
See you put up your wall, you know you did it,
The rise and the fall, just admit it

You say it's my fault, okay I get it
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it
It's the the rise and the fall
And you're good at it all

If you want it let's do it
Riding, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

If you want it let's do it
Riding, my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump on it, jump-jump on it

Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump on it, jump-jump on it
Lost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now
A drug and a drink
We lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again

Lost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again

<div class="lyricbox">Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry
'Cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again

Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah yeah

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Till I see you again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Till I see you again yeah yeah yeah whoa
Till I see you again
Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone.</div>
Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters, but you pushed me in

I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll do
Everything different, I'll be better to you

I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll be
Somebody different, I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me and pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll do
Everything different, I'll be better to you

I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll be
Somebody different, I'll be better to you

Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll do
Everything different, I'll be better to you

I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll be
Somebody different, I'll be better for you
So little to say, but so much time
Despite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay, I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new

Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me, first love
Forgive me, forgive me, first love
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out.

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

[Repeat Chorus]
So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
Even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Bridge]
Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah you hurt me but I learned alot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)

[Repeat Chorus]
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh)
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) woo woo (woo woo)

Yeah
[Bridge]
Now I've got me, myself and I (I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If ya cried a thousand times ladies you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through (After all the rain you'll see the sun come again)
<div class="lyricbox">I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure

How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 A.M. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure</div>
Yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
Oh you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
I don't know why, I just feel I'm better off,
Staying in the same room I was born in,
I look outside, and see a whole world better off,
Without me in it trying to transform it,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Listen, I know this one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds,
But the lyrics are so down,
It's ok though, because it represents, wait better yet, it is,
Who I feel I am right now,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Heard you say, "not today, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "there's no choice, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

Don't you test me though, just because I play the piano,
Doesn't mean I am not willing to take you down, I'm sorry

I'm out of my mind, I'm not seeing things right,
I waste all this time trying to run from you,
But I'm out of my mind.

Heard you say, "not today, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "there's no choice, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Heard you say, "not today, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "there's no choice, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise.

Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, not today
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
R.I.P to the girl you used to see 
her days are over 
baby shes over 
I've decided to give you all of me 
baby come closer 
I'm ready for ya! 
Kill 'em all, switch it up, 
put it on, zip it up 
Let my perfume soak it in your sweater, 
say you'll be here soon, sooner the better 
No option for you saying 'no'. 
I run this game, just play your role 
Follow my lead, whatchu waiting for? 
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night 

CHORUS 
Yeah i hear you talkin don't know who your tryin to flatter

I-ohoh, so keep thinkin your the man cause thats all part of my plan, 
I-I-I'm ready for ya 

Nothin on, I strut around, I do it big, I shut it down 
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me 
Mental pictures, no cameras please 

CHORUS 
Red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash 
Black loungeray, white diamonds what a contrast 

I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast, define fast 
Cause I could speed it up and make it last 
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast 
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past 
And make damn sure that you never forget it, 
admitt it 
I'm ready 
I'm wit it 
Still here like a statue pink champaigne 
Green ink in your tattoos 
You say you got baggage well I'm packed too 
Plus i got a sex pistol pointed right at you 
BANG 
The baddest woman ever and the hardest ????? 
proven over and over again thats why I'm hard to doubt 
plus I'm young money till death 
I took the carter out 
I'm more then ready too, hope it's somethin you thought about 

I-I-I'm ready for ya 
CHORUS 
R.I.P to the girl you used to see

I-ohoh, I-I-I'm ready for ya 
I-ohoh, so keep thinkin your the man cause thats all part of my plan, 
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on"

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
<div class="lyricbox">[Drake]
You won’t feel me until everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered
Then forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass getting thicker than the plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce
That shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down
They just keep on saying that they feel you nigga

[The Weeknd]
I’ve been faded too long, ooh
When will it stop? The ride

[Drake]
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced
Rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know its real when your
Latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga
It's been too long man

[The Weeknd]
I’ve been faded too long, ooh
When will it stop? The ride

[Drake]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty Jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m 'bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but shit I know a secret
They say mo' money mo' problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket-holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

[The Weeknd]
I'm still
Faded, faded, faded
The ride
Still
Faded, faded, faded
When will it stop? The ride
When will it stop? Ooh, the ride</div>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you

Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story of just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you
Mustard on the beat ho

I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

[Chorus]:
Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in 
on your love scene
slow dancing
(you stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone

[Chorus]
Tell me how to forgive you
when it's me who's ashamed
and I wish I could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple-
he's the one to blame

As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me

Big Sean
Yo, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it, I'll fly you to it
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me
As long as you lo-lo-lo.. (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love me (that's all I want baby)
As long as you love, love, love, love me (please don't go)
As long as you love me

You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places, fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times... I have committed

Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing

What kids are doing, are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free

Yeah, am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay

Fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

(I'll fake you out)
And I'll fall
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break
And I'll fake
(And I'll break you down)
All I wanna

I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

All I wanna
(And I'll fake you out)
Yeah, and I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
(And I'll break you down)

All I wanna
(I'll fake you out)
Yeah, and I'll fall down
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
(And I'll break you down)

All I wanna
I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space
Shut It Down lyrics
Drake
It's time to change your mobile Ringtone!
[Drake]
These girls ain't got nothing on you
uhh, say baby I had to mention
that if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
other girls they got attention
but I just always feel like there in need of something you got
obvious you're pretty
heard that your a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
and if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
put those f-cking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what your doing
put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus]
shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it, hey oh
these girls aint got nothing on you nothing on you

What you need
[The Dream]
I can be (I can be)
your everything

(who knew)
them other n-ggas
just wanna hit it but if they had it
wouldn't know what to do with it
(and together)

[Drake &amp; The Dream]
we shut it down down down
they know we shut it down down down
your the baddest girl around...

[The Dream]
(?)
you shut that muthf-cker down down
ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
you shut that muthaf-cker down down down
oh yeah,
yes indeed, you shut it down down
Drizzy, The American Dream

You shut that sh-t down
(down down down)
you shut it down
you shut it, ohh

you looking good girl
go go go get em girl,
go go go go hit em girl
go go go go go go
you shut it down
We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids,
Culture forbids,
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is,
To fall off the grid.

We live for the night's decor,
It reveals what we dream of.

I know there's someone at the door,
They called for help, of this I'm sure,
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great,
I know some people who know people who are flying straight,
But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression,
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again.

We live for the night's decor,
It reveals what we dream of.

I know there's someone at the door,
They called for help, of this I'm sure,
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

This room is far too dark for us to stay around,
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down.
Make them stop.

I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.
Make them stop.
In the circles I've been runnin'
I've covered many miles
And if I could search forever
For what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It wasn't nothing like I'd planned
And when I got my heart around it
It slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
Close my eyes and see it

In a midnight talk
In a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms
That's where it is
When we're tangled up 
And can't resist
When we feel that rush
That's where it is....... That's where it is

When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now

Bridge:
It's a lifetime filled
With tiny graces
The biggest things
In the smallest places

In the sweetest smile
On a night like this
In a tender touch
That's where it is
When we're tangled up
And can't resist
When we fill that rush
That's where it is.... That's where it is
<div class="lyricbox">Once upon a time our world was on fire and I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless, never any limits, guess I had a lot to learn
Cause fire turns to ember, embers to ashes that blow away too soon
k
Now everything’s after you is like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey

Looking back I guess it was really for the best
Still you’re something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go
You’re a habit hard to break
I got used to being high and nothing that I try seems good enough right now

It’s also watered down like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong
You can’t go back and you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey

Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It’s like having wine after whiskey</div>

<div class="lyricbox">"Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&amp;R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow..."

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
Holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

Cake, cake cake cake cake cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda' never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake cake cake
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
Fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

Fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all warned me on
I'm the big homie, they still tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just thoughts that I share with myself
But I thought Fuck It its worth it to share it with someone else more than Paris for once</div>
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move

Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old

It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old

It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
This is how the story went:
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And it was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
And watched you wave, and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Away, yeah...

Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
(Saukrates intro)
They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

(Drake verse 1)
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition,
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position.
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference,
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen.
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi,
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that  They'll buy,
Now I'm out in A-Town,
They tellin' me Trey sound,
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around.
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game.
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows,
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train.
Dog, personally mane,
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they Purpose is game.
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame,
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game,
I keep on, on, on, on, on

(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

(Saukrates verse 2)
Yeah.
Let me show you how to blast up,
Now tell me who is a masta.
A mind never wasted,
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up,
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up.
See where we from,
The 50's are bloody and the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown they love Me.
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money,
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of,
My lapel, is custom made,
You off the rack shit,
I'm off the chain, come on.

The dogs are loose,
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay,
With 40 and Mac Dre.
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk,
Drake'll give you the deal.
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills,
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill.
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)

(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I 'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

(Drake verse 3)
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda,
Ol' time killin'.
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin',
And now the girls like,
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place,
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin',
They one in the same when you need it to happen.
My city full of players they just needed a captain,
In need of him right now in need of him back then.
But back then I was actin',
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin.
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men,
Whoever chose to back out is back in,
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told,
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold.
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old.
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold.
And keep on, on, on, on, on

(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired, there ain't
No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...

No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Wanna find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing to do, they say
But someone, somewhere's gotta pay

And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this

Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much too much, and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend

And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be

Songs like this one that
Tell the whole world just
What a jerk you are

And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasen't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
No, if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-da, 
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba... ba-ba-ba... Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey, I can see the stars all the way from here;
Can't you see the glow on the windowpane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near;
Every time you touch me, I just melt away...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (it's gonna take a little work...) Whoa-oh!
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...)
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Come on, baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, baby, I can hear the wind whipping past my face,
As we dance the night away...
And boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne, 
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (that's it's gonna take a little work...) Oh-whoa, oh...
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only thing I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Always call...)
When I need you, baby, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Baby! You're the one that I love! Baby, you're all I need!
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I always call! (Calls...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, (you put my) love on top!

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love! Baby, you're the one that I need!
You're the only man I see...
Oh, baby, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls... (Calls...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love! (Love!) Baby, you're the one that I need! (Need!)
You're the only one I see... (See...)
Oh, baby, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Call...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Cada vez, cada vez que lo veo pasar
Mi corazo se enloquece
Y me empieza a palpitar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
No lo puedo controlar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
Y me empieza a cantar
Me canta asi

Bidi bidi bom bom

Cada vez, cada vez que lo oigo hablar
Me tiemblan hasta las piernas
Y el corazon igual
Bidi bidi bom bom

No lo puedo controlar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
Y me empieza a cantar

Me canta así, me canta a ti
Cada vez que lo veo pasar

Y me empieza a palpitar
Así, así</div>
This is all God's doing man you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man I'm only 29 have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
Face time with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yeah

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in a fucked up position
You gon make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro

Baby I'm a savage I ain't romantic
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic
And they pockets going under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstanding'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now (blasting)
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit
They the type to stand in line for some free shit
Babygirl gon suck it 'till her jaws locked
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin'
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come
You that nigga snitchin' on your people huh
21 savage aka the reaper huh
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin' huh

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in all fucked up position
Make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro

I don't need love I'm the G.O.A.T
I just hit the beat and float
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow
Mom's stressed theres a lot of things we need
Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreeze
Jordan pull up in the TL now I'm cheese
I'mma turn this TSX to a Benz soon
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon
150 inch screen in my bedroom
6'1" man that nigga need some leg room
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
Face time with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in all fucked up position
Make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro
When you look back on times we had
I hope you smile
And know that through the good and through the bad
I was on your side
When nobody could hold us down
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
And no they won't forget, yeah

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember

When you think back on all we've done
I hope you're proud
When you look back and see how far we've come
It was our time to shine
And nobody could hold us down
They thought they'd see us fall
But we, we stood so tall
And no we won't forget, yeah

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember

We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
You know that we, we showed them all
And no they won't forget, yeah

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember

 I love the way you make me feel
 I love it, I love it
 Tú eres todo para mí
 Te amo, I love it

[Mac Miller:]
 Say, I'm thinkin' 'bout her, every second, every hour
 Do my singin' in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like "do she love me? do she love me not?"
 I ain't a player I just...

[Ariana Grande:]
 You give me that kind of something, want it all the time, need it everyday
 On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
 Never get enough, I can't stay away
 If you want what I got, I got it everyday
 You can get whatever you need from me
 Stay by your side, I'll never leave you and I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

[Chorus:]
 So don't you worry, te necesito
 I got a bad boy, I must admit it
 You got my heart, don't know how you did it
 And I don't care who sees it, babe
 I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
 I love the way you make me feel
 I love it, I love it
 No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
 The way I love you

[Verse:]
 Oh, estoy loca, no no no no puedo ya dejarte de pensar
 Y tú me llevas hasta el cielo (el cielo) con tu modo de hablar
 Dame un beso, mi amor, y acariciame
 Llevame al cielo, enamorame
 Baby, yo quiero (estar contigo)
 No te vayas, escucha lo que digo

[Chorus:]
 So don't you worry, te necesito
 I got a bad boy, I must admit it
 You got my heart, don't know how you did it
 And I don't care who sees it, babe
 I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
 I love the way you make me feel
 I love it, I love it
 No se vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no se vivir (te amo, I love it)
 No se vivir, no

[Mac Miller:]
 I'll make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
 I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
 You a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time

[Chorus:]
 So don't you worry, te necesito

Little boy, six years old
A little too used to bein' alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that'll never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face:

"This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know 
This is my temporary home..."

Young mom on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a halfway house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we'll find our place here in this world..."

"This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know 
This is our temporary home..."

Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers:
"Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday..."
He looks up and says, "I can see God's face..."

"This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know 
This was my temporary home..."

This is our temporary home
Where 69 meets 40
There's a single stop light town
And back when I was really young
Part of that burned down
On any given Friday night
We'd drive a hundred miles
Between the Sonic and the grocery store
Laughing all the while
With as many friends as I could pack
In my Daddy's Ford
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

My hotel in Manhattan
Holds more people than our town
And what I just paid for dinner
Would be a down payment on a house
I'd rather be tipping cows in Tulsa
Then hailing cabs here in New York
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue sky
The Oklahoma kind

In a world of long red carpets
The bright lights of Hollywood
All the paparazzi flashing
Can make a girl feel pretty good
You can get anything you want here
Except a WalMart store
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue sky
The Oklahoma kind

Where the Wildcats beat the Iron Heads
Old settler's day and the Okra fest
After prom down at the bowling lanes
Catching crappy fish in Eufaula Lake
I ain't in Checotah anymore

Oh yeah
I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind

But I ain't in Checotah
No I ain't in Checotah
Oh, there's nothing like Oklahoma

Where 69 meets 40
There's a single stop light town
I'on think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up rite before the store clothes
And blow the feed from my last 4 shows
I do 1 song &amp; use 4 flows
She use to be a christian before...
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes,
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me &amp; the salesman build a reporso
He understands tha fact that I'm spending all sure doe
Cash only, transactions homie,
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dnt know I bought it
I been doin this for yrs homie, thoroughly I thought it
Thru, what it do? I am currently recorded on a track &amp; made most of my currency's imported
We're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker, playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A mis kite as they say is a legal bender
And ATF is present every legal memeber
The coalition, is so officient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so dnt try to make Compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen,
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in a basement that rennie gru was pimpin
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with pimpin'
'til I met janette I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, NIGGA
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day tht Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm a comer w. great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate somethingg
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
They collo that I just purchased is sound vacant
'cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic,
Aside from the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life...
When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
To hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Eerything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on
I'll give you all I have,
And nothing less, I promise...
Love me and don't look back;
I want you with me on this road to the sky...
We'll be shining every night,
I promise you, just me and you,
Oh, I promise you...
Na na na na, oh oh

When the leader of the bad guys sang,
Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must've forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please, take me.

Na na na na, oh oh

Three lights are lit but the fourth one's out,
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,
I forgot about the drought of lightbulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,

But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I'm thinking, "wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house."

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please,

I don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don't know if this one is about me or the devil.

I don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don't know if this one is about me or the devil.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please,

Na na na na, oh oh
I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly
 
I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say

Hello, hello, hello, hello
I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly
 
I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say

Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello, yeah

Hello, hello, hello, hello
A gift (a gift) from Virgo... (Virgo...)
Oh... (Virgo...)

I wish I could look in your eyes, and tell you how I feel right now, inside;
Baby, I know that it's real (real), so real (real), so real (real), so real...

Mmm... (Miss you...)
How I wish I could be with you...
(I miss you...)
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now...

Every morning, every afternoon, every night, I wanna be with you;
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in a hotel room all day,
I just wanna be with you...
I love everything about you, from your old-school tennis shoes, 
to the way you move when you're dancing with me...

Do you remember our first kiss? It wasn't long enough...
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together? They were not long enough...
All of our conversations, all of your sweet pages, they're never long enough...

When it's time for me to leave, it's so hard to say good-bye;
I never want to say good-bye... I never ever want to say good-bye...

One day, we'll make love;
Finally, I'll be yours...
Only you, only you - I could love you...
But it's too late: I already love you...
I love you (I love you), I love you (I love you), I love you... (I love you...)
Midnight shadows 
Where finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

We're gonna be alright... (Hey...)
We're gonna be alright... ah, yeah, ah yeah...
We're gonna be alright...

Baby, don't you know
All them tears gon' come and go

Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it

We're gonna be alright... alright... (Hey...)
We're gonna be alright... (Ah, ah, ah...) ah, yeah... (Hey...)
We're gonna be alright...

In slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the hard times are golden
'Cause they all lead to better days

We're gonna be alright... (Hey...)
We're gonna be alright, yeah... (We're gonna be alright, boy!) Ah, yeah, ah yeah...
We're gonna be alright...

Baby, don't you know
All them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
Then every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby don't you know
All them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it

We're gonna be alright... (Hey...)
We're gonna be alright... ooh, baby! Ooh, ooh... (Ah, yeah... ah yeah...)

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I'm convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrr
I'm on that wave tonight I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay
You know Jay Wray
Got girls her going way, way, way, way, way, way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Load up off a gate way
Man you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days, all in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid

Justin Bieber
Never say never
(never, ever)

Yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never

Ne-never say never (never)

I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh

And there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (never say never) I will fight
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!)
I got ya little bro
I can handle him
Hold up
I, I can handle him

Jaden Smith
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never (never say it, never say it)
Say never (okay, okay)

Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
never, never, say never
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never
<div class="lyricbox">If you’re tired of your life and the way that you feel
Like a fish on a hook,
Like a bug on a dirty windshield, it’s ok
It’s time to take your chips and cash them all in
Cause it matters where you’re going
Not where you been, say hey
Goodbye yesterday
Well if life don’t go your way
Maybe it’s time to take a break,
Yeah, yeah

Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, just kick it
We got a one way ticket
Sunshine and bright and it’s meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it
We got a one way ticket

So pack up your smile and your new flip flops
We’re headed to a heaven where the beach don’t stop
Dance the day and the night away
Grab yourself a gal,
Grab yourself a fella,
Grab yourself a drink with a pink umbrella
Goodbye yesterday
Well if life don’t go your way
Maybe it’s time to take a nice long break

Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, woo, just kick it
We got a one way ticket
Sunshine and bright and it’s meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, eh
We got a one way ticket

Ou la la la la la
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Push that clock and call it a day
Say adios to the minimum wage
Tell your boss man where he can stick it
We got a one way ticket
Life is so good, it’s sticky sweet
It’s a carnival cotton candy treat
All wrapped in a lollipop, lick it
We got a one way ticket</div>
[Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change it, I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show

When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends, when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do

One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

[Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt
By someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...
I've loved and I've lost
Yeah, yeah

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)

Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

They still out to get me, they don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
They like Pablo, "why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I...
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki
(Perfect)

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)
[Drake: Talking]
Uh, Yea, Get In My Slick Rick Mode
N'a Mean?, Im A Tell Ya A Story Real Quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look,
She Got A Saying Theres No Alice Without The Tin Man
Crib Was 2 Mil, Plus I Just Bought A Couch For Ten Grand
Even If The House Was Ten Grand
And There Was No Pool
Would I Still Be Witout My Swim Fan?
The Ceiling Could Be Higher
She Making Requests
Dont Know If She Feeling Me Or She Be Feelin What I Buy Her
And Purses Are Light Now
She Use Em All The Time
So She Smilin To The The Point That It Hurt When She Bite Down
And She Simply A New Model
Stay Spendin Dollars
But She Got Less Sense Than A Empty Perfume Bottle
At Times She A Solid Chick
And Im A Sucka For The Cuties
So She Always Lookin Good When My Wallets Thick
Chillin On The Linen, She All Up In The Closet So Much
Got A Hunch Thats Shes Feelin Other Women
Want The Diamonds On The Face In The Center
Nice Guys Finish Last So Im Winnin Every Race That I Enter And She A

[Chorus:]
Video Girl
Eh Yo You Have To Listen
Im In A Bad Position

Video Girl

Video Girl
And You Betrayed Your Wealth
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
You're All The Same
Look At Vida Guerrera
Theres No Need To Compare Her
I Bet She Smiles Cuz She Loves What She Sees In The Mirror
I Bet Shes Out Meetin Directors Instead
And Frustratrated Cuz Shes Already Been Addressed In They Head
Be A Teacher, Open Up Shop If You Can Do Nails Fine
Apply For A Business Loan And I'll Bet You That They'll Sign
If You A Real Dime
Poppin As If Its Your Only Option
Girl Theres Things To Do
Other Than Jail Time
Look This Aint A Song Dissing Half Of These Rappers
Or Pasha And Sasha, Esther Baxter
Melyssa Ford, Or Katy Or Anyone After
I Just Give My Opinion For Laughter
Or Maybe To Think On
So Next Time You Out At The Club
And A Brother Offers The Whole Table Something To Drink On
You Just Take In Effect He Got A Stack With A Mink On
Now He Got You Doing Everything That You Think Wrong
Look, You Tell Your Parents That Its Cash At An Easy Pace
Ya Dad Screaming Take Ya Ass Outta Jeezy Face
And As Ya Man I Wont Back Down First
But They Got You Doing Soft-Core Background Work
That Messed Up Like An Officer That Pulls You Over
And He Ask Questions Later And Pat Down First
But You Aint Thandie Newton, And This Aint Crash Here
The Resolutions Passed Baby, This Aint Last Year
Look, I Got A Message, I'll Say It
I Got Some Beats Still
Regina Hall And Garcelle And Alice Neal
Young Girls These Here Women With Big Dreams
Role Models That You Can Watch On The Big Screen
If You Refuse To Change And You That Chick Still
Respect Yourself, Dont Be Convinced That These Tricks Will
You Got An Audience Believe It Or Not
My Cousin Who Cant Speak Know The Lyrics To Tip Drill

[Chorus:]
Video Girl
Eh Yo You Have To Listen

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah...
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold
Oh
She gon' love that... I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
If I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
I let you go
Bitch in the house off the coast
She gon' take everything I own
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
I let you go
It's in the 'Bach or the Rolls
She gon' profit everything I taught
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go.
(Turn the lights on) 

Every night I rest in my bed 
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you 
When I close my eyes 
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this? 

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere 
Baby long as you're here 
I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 

I mention you when I say my prayers 
I wrap you around all of my thoughts 
Boy you're my temporary high 
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby 
What kinda dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere
Baby long as you're here 
I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this? 

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere 
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my, 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it
Yeah, you're the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
Don't know why I think I can lie
'Cause there's a screen on my chest
Yeah there's a screen on my chest

I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I can't see past my own nose
I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground
Just like a vertical locomotive, that's a train
Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane

My flow's not great, okay
I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time
Getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky

I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

We're broken
We're broken people, oh
We're broken people, oh, yeah

We're broken
We're broken people, oh
We're broken people, oh, yeah

We're broken
We're broken people, oh
We're broken people, oh, yeah

(We're broken, we're broken)
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

(We're broken, we're broken)
I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
That lipstick on your collar, 
Well it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume,
It's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain 
On the pocket of your white cotton thread 
Well you drink beer and whiskey, boy
And you know I don't drink red

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor 
You should've hid it in the closet
You should've burned it, you should've lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind and say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in, "I'm late again, oh I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

If the neighbours get to asking
I won't cover nothing up
I'll tell 'em every detail
How you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down 
And slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve 
To come knockin' on my door

Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind and say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in, "I'm late again, oh I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

Oh oh oh oh oh

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor 
You should've hid it in the closet
You should've burned it, you should've lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind and say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in, "I'm late again, oh I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

Out to dry
To the line
Oh woah
<div class="lyricbox">Did you check the tires, put gas in the car?
Don't think you'll need too much,
‘Cause you ain't gonna get that far
Did you pack the good times?
Don't forget a map
Just incase the route you take isn't there to take you back

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better 
When you're lost, and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is 
But you won't find this no you won't find this

There's once in a lifetime
And there's once in a while
And the difference between the two
Is about a million miles 
Oh you might get lucky
While the moon is looking on
But in the truth of the morning 
The stars will be long gone

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better 
When you're lost and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is 
But you won't find this no you won't find this

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better 
When you're lost, and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is, 
oh in the end it's me you're gonna miss
‘cause you won't find this, oh you won't find this</div>

She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you, and boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it (rumour)


She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it (rumour)


All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it (rumour)



But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah oh

I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest
The star of my show
So many times I wished
You'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this
Girl what you do to me

You're who I'm thinking of
Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what you're always number one

My prize possession
One and only
Adore ya girl I want ya
The one I can't live without
That's you (that's you)
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl

You're used to going out your way
To impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
Is a dream that can't be real
So girl let's write a fairytale
And show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of (of)
Girl you ain't my runner up (up)
And no matter what you're always number one

My prize possession
One and only
Adore ya girl I want ya
The one I can`t live without
That's you (that's you)
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
Baby it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl

You take my breath away
With everything you say
I just wanna be with you
My baby, my baby oh-oh
Promise to play no games
Treat you no other way
Than you deserve 'cause you're the girl of my dreams

My prize possession
One and only
Adore ya girl I want ya
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady

Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off

So just forget about the world, be young tonight

Baby do it like you do

Who can make my life complete
It's all about you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

Nicki Minaj:
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know imma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep my eye out for Selena
Beauty, beauty and the beast

Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go)

Justin Bieber:
Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all about you, when the music makes you move

[Talking:]
Yeah, This Dedicated To Canada Man
The Whole Up North
A Lot Of People Don't Realize How Cold It Gets During The Winter
But Listen...

[Verse 1:]
I Met This New Girl Late June Or Early July
I Called Her A Bunch Of Times But She Barely Replied
Now It's December, I'm Driving, And She's Like Where's My Hi?
I Swear, That I Never Called You Cause I Really Get Shy
See That Was A Segue, I Believe The Matter
Is What Happens After The Seaon Where The Leaves Just Scatter
Where The Timb Laces Get Tighter And Parka Hoods Flip Up
Drugs Dealers Standin And They Parka Hoods Slip Up
Where Girls Become Exes From Summer's Caught Ho'in
The Winter Cars Come Out, The Summer Cars Go In
And Some Places Is Breezy, And Some It Start Snow-Ing
And If You Planning Family Vacations You Better Know When
But Some Mothers Scared To Send They Daughters Out The City
Instead She Get A Sweater That She Bought Her Out Of Pity
Cause Mom Stays Up Late, She Seen Them Videos
Where Cancun College Students Pouring Water On Their Titties!

[Talking: Over Chorus]
Yeah Man, It's A Funny Thing Going Through The Winter Up Here Man
A Lot Of Girls Y'know, Wanna Get Close. You Might Think They The One
But Just Wait, Nah Mean, Take It Slow

[Verse 2:]
Forget To Mention, This Girl That Never Gets To The Beach
She Lives Just West Of My Street, And So We Destined To Meet
Since I'm Driving, I Ask Her How To Get The Suite
She Doesn't Answer, Opens The Door And Just Gets In The Seat
She Throws Her Bag In The Back, And Starts Adjusting The Heat
She's Bold But I Roll With It, I'm Impressed Cause She's Sweet
Then She Says "I Heard Your Song And I'm Obsessed With The Beat,
I Mean, The Lyrics Are Good, But I'm Obsessed With The Beat
I Love It When Voyce Sings And The Chorus Is Good,
There's A Couple Things In The Song That I Suggest You Repeat"
Off This I'm Kinda Takin It Back For A Second, 
I Get Her Number She Tells Me To Call Her After This Session
And So I Do, And It's Kind Of Awkward, The Surface Hard To Scratch
Until We End Up Sexin And Now My Heart Attached
I'm Thinkin Off I Should've Been More Southern
And Realizing All That She Wanted Was That Indoor Lovin And Ho!

[Talking: Over Chorus]
Yeah, Uh, I Told Ya'll I Had A Story For You Right
Uh, Ya Man, It's What It Is

[Verse 3:]
And Now, I'm Proud To Have Her Like Montreal To The Frizzench
She Love To Play Hurt Like Carter Did On The Bizzench
But, My Boy Say I'm Actin Different, Because I Lay Downtown
And I Still I Rush To Pick Her Up From Work And Fizzench
She Tellin Everyone Imma Hold Here Down
Tell Everyone I'm The Prince Up In This Cold Clear Town
And Stupid Me I Just Listen To Her, 
Instead Of Wondering If This Is Really Gon' Last Me The Whole Year Round
But Then Spring Shows Up, And It's Dallas In This Bitch
The Weather Starts To Resemble The Holidays She Missed
When We Were Together It Seeming Like Way Back When
Ball Players Hop On The Plane And Make It Way Back In
See She Used To Play Piana, And Now She Never Wait For Santa
Instead Of Saving For Marriage, She Saving For Carrabanna
And It's A Shame, She Had Me Convinced That She Could've Been A Dime
I Guess, I Lost Another One To The Wintertime

[Voice + (Drake):]
I Miss You, Most Of Aaaallll, Myy Daarling [Beat Fades Out]
(Gimme A Second To Gather My Toughts)
[Fades Back In] Strolling In The Park (Ho!)
And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing (Such A Beautiful Day Man)
(Yeah Man, You Know We Had To Switch It On 'em Right?)
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing
(I'm Still Standing On Two Feet, Even After This Tragic Loss)
(Man, But I Got Something To Else To Tell Ya Baby)

[Rap:]
I Remember Them Encore Pms, Breakfast And The Wake Up
Now Drake's Committed We Waiting On The Breakup
So We Can Get Back To Them Cognac Nights 
With Dress Codes And Light Skinned Girls That Won't Act Right
And I Laugh Cause My Previous Lifestyle Was Quite Wild
The Winter Came And Blew His Cold Air Through
Back Then Light Sweaters And A Couple Drinks Might Get Her, 
By The End Of The Week I Would Know That Crew
And We'd Assembled A Trio, A Whole New Scene
With Three Ladies In The Shot We Never Broke Routine
At The End Of Every Cut When The Cameras Are Rollin
We Had Ladie's Hearts Always Gettin Damaged And Stolen
But This Summer Is Different It's A Two Man Operation
Granted The Fact That We One Man Short
Got Love For Him He Can Watch This New Man Stop A Nation
Cause Handin' Them Crack Is A One Man Sport
Instead Of Dress-Up, I Walk In Sweat Pants And Chomp Clinkin'
I Find A Girl We Step Dance And Calm Drinkin'
The Face, The Breast, The Bras, The Toes
I'm Still Solo And A Long Night Draws To A Close
Cause It's A Fact, If She Come To The Crib And I Get Some Ass Inside
We'll Never Talk Again, Scary And True 
That Song Special I Recorded With Voyce Well It's Like A Classified
It's What I'm Lookin For To Carry Me Through
Yet I Can't Seem To Find A Heavy Girl That Possesses It
Only Wants A Friendship Causing Me To Forget The Shit
And When They Talk About They Past And Lovers
And You Get Mad At The Though Of It Giving Ass To Others
Yet You Find Peace With Yourself, Now Least There's Some Room To Ride
There's Also Room For Improvement As Soon As June Arrive

[Voice:]
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing

<div class="lyricbox">I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won’t you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won’t you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

Lay down with me

Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won’t you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)</div>
<div class="lyricbox">(Whoa, whoa)
(H-h-here we go)

Center of attention once again
They don’t understand
They don’t understand, no

Then they try to tell me who I am
They don’t understand
They don’t understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can’t be looking for me then
I don't even need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told

I see you thinking 
But there's just one thing de-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand, no

Thinking you're the reason that it ends
But you won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can’t be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs
Is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me 'cause that's not reality
And so I can't be a silhouette of who I'm becoming
You don't know me but there's more to see, my love

You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Untill you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(You don't know me)
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
And you don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
But there's just one thing d-e-e-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love
(My love)</div>
<div class="lyricbox">You ain't gotta answer none of my calls. 
I'm believing you'll pick up one day. 
I don't wanna add to your pain at all. 
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life. 
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life. 
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else. 
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself. 
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure. 

Thought that you were in it for the paper. 
Never thought I'd take you serious. 
Now I need you, not a moment later. 
Losin' it, I'm so delirious. 
And I'ma put up a fight for it. 
Never give up a love like this. 
Finally I found someone. 
That can do me like no other. 
Talking to my conscience. 
I made a few mistakes. 
I did it to myself. 
I'm the only one to blame. 
I know you need a little while to believe again. 
To love again. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll be waiting for you. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll still. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 

Put my key in the ignition. 
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me. 
I know that you ain’t got no plans to leave. 
Girl I need your attention. 
And every time I see you make that face. 
I wanna love you all over the place. 
Don't do it, baby. 
Don't do it to me, no. 

I know you don't wanna talk, right. 
We've been on and off like the crosslights. 
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right? 
When I touch you, I get frostbite. 
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold. 
How we so young but livin' so old? 
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo. 
That could drive you loco. 
You supposed to me my uno, Yoko Ono. 
Oh no, round two again. 
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken 
Last time we argued eight straight days. 
I learned my lesson, I got straight As. 
And I know it's deeper than masseuses. 
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious 
Go ahead and take the time. 
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine. 
Think about it. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll be waiting for you. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
Right now, don't rush, no pressure. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up. 
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I'll still. 
Don't rush, no pressure. 

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now. 
I know I did you wrong. 
Let your heart heal. 
Don't rush, no pressure.</div>
[Intro: Rick Ross]
All we wanted was opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Hefner and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real
Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription strength of the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great
<div class="lyricbox">Beyoncé
Oh la la la
Don't hurt yourself

Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch boy
You can watch my fat ass twist boy
As I bounce to the next dick boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Get a bigger smile on my face, being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
Motivate your ass call me Malcolm X
Yo operator, or innovator
Fuck you hater, you can't recreate her no
You'll never recreate her no, hero

We just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be baby
You just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be

Chorus: Jack White
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself
When you diss me, you diss yourself
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself, don't hurt yourself
When you love me, you love yourself
Love God herself

Beyoncé
I am the dragon breathing fire
Beautiful mane I'm the lion
Beautiful man I know you're lying
I am not broken, I'm not crying, I'm not crying
You ain't trying hard enough
You ain't loving hard enough
You don't love me deep enough
We not reaching feats enough
Blindly in love, I fucks with you
Till I realize, I'm just too much for you
I'm just too much for you

We just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be baby
Hey baby, who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis V boy
Just give my fat ass a big kiss boy
Tonight I'm fucking up all your shit boy

Both
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Try not to hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself
You only lying to yourself
When you love me, you love yourself
Love God herself

Beyoncé
We just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be baby
Uh, this is your final warning
You know I give you life
If you try this shit again
You gon' lose your wife</div>
[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you don't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this hit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's whats important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga , ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Hook]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga 
, do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga 
, do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas )

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Hook]

Sometimes, these walls seem to cave in on me,
But when I look in your eyes, I feel alive...
Some days, we say words that don't mean a thing,
But when you're holding me tight, I feel alive...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you,
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive...
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name,
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive,
So now, let's just live it up...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

Baby, last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue...

We gotta hold on...
I gotta hold on...
You've got to hold on...
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me...

We gotta hold on...
I've gotta hold on...
You've got to hold on...
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue...

[Blue Ivy:]
Hold on to me, hold on...
Bee-sy-ay, Bee-sy-ay...
(Blue...) Bee-sy-ay...
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
Mrs. Carter...
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't all greed
There's too much that I haven't said

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

Why were you so cold, let the truth me told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I died in your arms

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Hope you know, I won't let go
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say "a guarantee"
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

I give you my all
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, baby, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I give you my all
I give you my voice
This song's for you
Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh 
On A star 

And I'm wishing on a star 
To follow where you are 
I'm wishing on a dream 
To follow what it means 
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
I wish on all the people who really dream 
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes. 
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done 
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be 
So far away from home 
So far away from me 
Just think of all the moments that we can spend 
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant 
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know, 
In the game of love, you reap what you sow 

I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby 
When we're together 
Whether or never 
I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby. 
When we're together. 
(Let's get together, baby) 
Whether or never. 

And I'm wishin on a star 
To follow where you are 
And I'm wishing on a dream
You've been on my mind, I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go, you're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

If I've been on your mind, you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go? 

I don't know why I'm scared, 'cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it, nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Take my arm, take my head
Make your mark like a man
Write your name, gonna write your name
Hurts so good, love and pain
When all fades, you remain
Write your name, gonna write your name

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

Write your name
Gonna write your name

Permanent, leave your scar
When you're gone, you' re never far
Write your name, gonna write your name
Cover me, all you are, over me, your signature

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

It's your name across my heart
Written in gold, a permanent mark
Let em' graved, It's what we are,
More than words, this love is art
Poetry emotion, put it right there
Deeper than skin, crystal clear
Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved
Write your name, across my heart

Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart
Write your name
Gonna write your name
That's what they doin', camera on, they actin' like these singers, man. I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation. A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer. Who gonna be on the hook? Man, what is you doin'? Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear what?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing) Ahh, nuh shake
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan tek Gill
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van
You know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we..

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing
Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve? 
It's been there for days on end and 
It's been waiting for you to open up 
Yours too baby, come on now 
I'm trying to tell you just how 
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally 
Say that it's always been me 

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before 
And I'm all you need and that you never want more 
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue 
But you'd save the best for last 
Like I'm the one for you 

You should know that you're just a temporary fix 
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me 
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free 
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest 
It turns out it ain't enough cause you're still not mentioning love 
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly? 
I'm taking these chances and getting away 
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her 
And I think that I know things may never change 
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel a way you've never felt before 
And I'm all you need and you never want more 
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue 
But you'd save the best for last 
Like I'm the one for you 

You should know that you're just a temporary fix 
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me 
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free 
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me 

But, despite the truth I know 
I find it hard to let go and give up on you 
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around 
And I will until I find myself with you and

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And we'll say all of the right things without a clue 
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you
Girl I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you love me
We let it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I felt victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl you're in your only
Rather be stuck in the night, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With thought of you, with thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you

You-hoo-hoo, you-hoo-hoo
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with thought of you
You-hoo-hoo, you-hoo-hoo
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you
[Verse 1]
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, i'm too alive
But i still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans, but neither was making it and here i am
In the presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since i saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon, she deserve the credit for how i'm about to get it
That's why i got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (lord)
Seems like yesterday that i was up and coming
Still so young that i ain't had enough of nothing

The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well fuck let's get it then

[hook]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ahh
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no

Are you down, are you down? yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am i down, am i down? yeah, i'm all the way down, we'll be fine

[verse 2]
Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man
Loved you until now, but now i'm the nigga man
You keep talking that, "you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it"
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man i got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can i take you home?
Or come to where you stay? do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, i never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", i said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least i admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then fuck let's get it then

[hook]
[birdman]
Yeah! drizzy, yo turn nigga!
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck em, we don't love em!
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, (to this gangsta shit)
Ovo ymcmb (belee that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That ymcmb shit nigga; flashy lifestyle
One hundred

Southern Smoke!!!

[Intro: Drake Talking]
Yeah. Ren. M.O.F. Haha. 
It's Drake man. It's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma half to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO!  Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing
The samples that they using, can't get through the clearing
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careering forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doing what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son he gon miss you
And plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
Now you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'ma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border 
But

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what I been through
I write a verse addressing it, and yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school,
Me being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered, I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigger" I'd punch them I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve, I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Because black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest, should I strive for my spot as the best
Like girls with Double D's, I gotta lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of staring at quizzes (?) now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician 
Homie, I probably could of been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, or maybe Petey's assistant 
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson
Nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been
Around the world and back, and I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

[Chorus: Nickelus F (Drake ad-libs)]
I got stress on my shoulders (Uh!)
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder (Yeah!)
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older (Oh!)
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers (Yeah man!)
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (This that gritty shit boy)
I'm just trying to live my life cuz (Got me winded over here man)
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (Uh)
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've got to find my own, my own
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

On the eve of a day
That's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don't need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
'Cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There's something we need

I'm not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you what I'm sing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore
And that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'm sorry
Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you were more like an out of town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah

Oh, no, no she's my out of town girl, girl, girl
She's my out of town girl,
She's my out of town girl
Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you

Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you

Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take you and leave the world with one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world

One less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh,

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line," ok
Made a million, off of denim
fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me

All me forreal

I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But thats was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me dont play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck wit' us and we don't fuck wit' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'mma make it last forever,
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

Hoe, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, needles it
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch

All Me. All Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking all that kush all in our section like its legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm less than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, touching they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do.
<div class="lyricbox">Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone, lone, lone

I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always
Be better than Sundays 'cause Sundays are my suicide days

I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress…

…ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green, gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees

Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora's Box's contents look nonviolent

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind's shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could
Find, I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you got to kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

Made it this far
Made it this</div>

[Outro: Beyonce]
I see your face and a
you wanna touch it and,
come to my place and we
can discuss it..Hollywood,
Welcome to Hollywood.
I love you, need you
Need you to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Is this what you want? The baddest, the baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, have to have it, hit it twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed Imma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (don't touch)

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

(Irreplaceable, irreplaceable)
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you? (nothing, no nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you... (I won't shed a tear...)
I won't lose a wink of sleep, 'cause the truth of the matter is 
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin', baby, hey hey

You must not know 'bout me
'Cause I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, nigga, pack all yo' bags, we finished
You must not know 'bout me, 'cause you made your bed, now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable
<div class="lyricbox">I'm more than just an option
Hey, hey, hey
Refused to be forgotten
I took a chance with my heart
And I feel it taking over

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I’m more than just a number
Hey, hey, hey
I doubt you’ll find another
So every single summer
I'll be the one that you remember

And I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It’s more than just a mission
Hey, hey, hey
You hear but you don’t listen
You better pay attention
And get what you been missing

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I’ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I’m done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart</div>
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love

But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it?

Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Ok there comes a time when you gotta be like
You know I've come this far on my own
Done a lot for myself
Where to now Ya know
But I just tell myself this one thing

It was worth it it was all worth it
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose
And I got verses I got verses
My 16's should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied You see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's over priced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come over night
Got got got got damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh tell me you surfin let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let em let em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful I'm living perfection
And man if 09 is when I'm a see mine

Looks like an angel, so picturesque 
Like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aiming right at your chest

By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround
You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowing in the wind, come sundown
Call a girl like that

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, love the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away

You'll see her name, alive or dead
Yeah but take her either way cause she's wanted
If I were you, I'd place my bet
That she's ridin' off out into the sunset

With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt
Let me tell you, boy, you're never gonna catch her

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, love the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Oh baby, run away

Ooh yeah yeah
Young gunslinger makin' new amends
Tough as nails under that corset
Call her renegade runaway, runaway, runaway

Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away
She's a renegade

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

[Chorus]:
Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in 
on your love scene
slow dancing
(you stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone

[Chorus]
Tell me how to forgive you
when it's me who's ashamed
and I wish I could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple-
he's the one to blame

ay

oh

Hey!

[Chorus]</div>
Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all responsibility
I'd go out of my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same

Maybe you could change me

Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing
Be like Serenity
Help me position my mind
Take a chance
Make a difference in my life

Maybe you could change me

Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
<div class="lyricbox">I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time’s been sweet to you

As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes, there’s good in goodbye

I don’t regret it
The time we had together
I won’t forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah I’m happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I’ll see you on the street
And it’d be bittersweet

As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes, there’s good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah

As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you got to let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Yeah someday you’ll see the reason why
There’s good in goodbye, yeah
There’s good in goodbye</div>

Oh, oh oh ohoh
(And I pray)

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Ooh, I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray yeah
I close my eyes and...

I pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls that need a break
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (and I pray)
I close my eyes and I pray (oh)
ohohoh

I pray (oh, and I pray)
I pray

I close my eyes and pray
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
Night falls with gravity
The earth turns from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lie; his name is Hope

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near

When the sun is coming, window soothes
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills its grave

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside my mind

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live, yeah yeah yeah

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on

By the time the night wears off
The dust is down and shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the night's return

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside my mind

[DRAKE:]
It's Southern Smoke Boy ! 
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy

[VERSE 1: DRAKE]
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen i might seem desitend for millions
Promoters on my ass so im guessing they filled
In i take q's from my big boy popz
I 'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar
Get it guess not picture me not strive 
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust im hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me
Now a day i peep they intrests
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up 
I put a split in the middle then i seperater

[CHORUS: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

[VERSE 2:]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[CHORUS: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

[VERSE 3: TREY SONGZ]
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

[BRIDGE:]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)

[CHORUS x2: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

[VERSE 4:]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

<div class="lyricbox">The winner is Beyonce Knowles
Female pop vocalist!

I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston

And I've been drifting off of knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks
Man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge
I preach my gut it can't help ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don’t trust these record labels, I’m touring
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up
Ghost around

What goes up
Ghost around
Ghost around...

Soul not for sale
Prob’ly won’t make no money off this
Oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Umh

It’s what you do
It’s what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You lucky?
The bedroom's the wrong way
Slap me, I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you
You must be on to me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you

You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)

Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)</div>
Didn't I give it all, tried my best?
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here

But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily, I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is for you

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl

You left me wanting what we were

Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away...just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl

You left me wanting what we were

Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever
I was a liar, I gave into the fire;
I know I should've fought it - at least I'm being honest...
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you;
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar...

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it,
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it...
Can't you forgive me at least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful...

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest, yeah-ee;
Just stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it, babe,
'Cause I don't want to be without you...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home; (Takes you home, boy...)
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go... (I promise that... let you go...)
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart; 
All I really care is you wake up in my arms... (Wake up in my arms...)
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

Ever have let you down? (no)

You know why
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby

We're big enough

But now I'm bigger

A heart breaker

I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger

It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed close
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby

We're big enough
To stand in the picture
To stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger

Cause we're bigger
Love bigger

A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger

I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoaa

Remember those stroll down street?

Don't knock you earrings, like yesterday
They shine on me
We were little then
In class daydreamed about you ooooohhohh
Just remember you ooooohhohh

Since then all I can remember is the love
Falling down

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger

And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger (love bigger)

Cause we're bigger
Love bigger

You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage

Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot

Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?

Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier

Thank you, thank's Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired boss
<div class="lyricbox">She remembers the nights he’d come calling
His yellow-silk tie
In love she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride

Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever changed

She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then

Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever child
Forever changed

Some days she’ll talk about aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when she’s coming over
And why she hasn’t called
Some days I just hold her fragile hand
As Tom crawls across the floor
Some days it just kills me
To watch her memories slip away a little more

Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever child
Forever loved
Forever changed</div>
When I'm here in your arms I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinchin' myself I don't care, I'm with you, you're with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams.

When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, 
Ohh

Let me know, if this is a dream, 
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, 
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me

I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
Is like I'm where I'm supposed to be.

When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, 
Ohh.

If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

It took a lot of time just to get to, to be with you baby
And now that I'm here with you I'm gonna take it in, breath you in
And if I'm dreaming let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I rather dream about you than be living life without me and you.
You

Let me know, if this is a dream, 
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)

[Bun B - Verse 1]
Now when it come to making money I'm a printing press
When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test
I run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history I'm like (?) son
A million ways to die you already chose one
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
We on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
And while ya there let em know we did it just for them
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
Is that the King of the trill go tell em yes it's him
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us
Now thats a plus on the report card not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters
You got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us

[Drake - Chorus]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

[Bun B - Verse 2]
They know I'm on a Port Arthur state of mind southern superstar status
I elevate the crime
My time is money so I put some money on my time
Lightening on the Breitling so exciting when you see that shine
We on that leather (?) before its never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
And in '0-10 we finna go in
So let the opposition know there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
Tell em stand down before it's man down

[Drake - Chorus]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

[Drake - Verse 3]
I gotta hundred girls on each phone
Drissy Drake man, young sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Home sick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time everyday we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard n-gga I'm quoting more n-gga
Results are in I guess you should have voted more n-gga
Swimming in the money y'all just float ashore n-gga
Never drowning what the f-ck you think this boat is for n-gga
Yeah I'm quick to take an RnB diva out
I'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done I'll put some slippers on and see them out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just trying to keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler everyday I'm riding clean
Ohhh

[Drake - Chorus]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down.
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
to take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done
La la la la
La la la la (oh yeah)

I want you to love me
Like I'm a hot ride
Be thinkin' of me
Doin' what you like

So boy, forget about the world
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it
Then I'mma make you swallow your pride

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world

Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

Want you to take it
Like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow
Make me feel right

Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'
You can come inside (yeah)
And when you enter, you ain't leavin'
Be my prisoner for the night, oh

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world, girl in the world
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me closely, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah

I'll close my eyes,'cause then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're home with me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I will feel that power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah

When you don't
Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground 
Eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the Earth 
And I'm soaked in your love, love 
And love was right in my path, in my grasp 
And me and you belong 

I wanna run, run
Smash into you 

Ears closed, what I hear no one else has to know. 
Cause I know that what we have is worth first place in gold 
And I'm soaked in your love, love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp 
And me and you  belong 

I wanna run, run
Smash into you 
Smash into you

Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground 
Eyes shut, I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth 
And I'm soaked in your love, love 
And love is right in my path, in my grasp 
And me and you belong 

Oh, I wanna run 
Smash into you 
I'm willing to run, smash into you 
I'm willing to run and run and run and run 
R-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
R-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
And I wanna run, run 
Smash into you 
I'm willing to run, run
Smash into you
With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone

I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion

Last night I got served a little bit too much
Of that poison, baby
Last night I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor 
And I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name

We left the club right around 3 o'clock 
In the morning
His Pinto sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

Today, I woke up
Thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
Outta nowhere
I gotta go 
Take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here
All of this will disappear
There's just one little problem:

I don't even know my last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done? What have I done? What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh yeah
There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
'Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind 'cause my heart lost all control
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
'Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne

All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it
All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
'Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
<div class="lyricbox">Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
You’d be a billionaire in a year
That’s what you gotta think ‘till you’re there, on the record line

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don’t condone it, love is a component
You’re the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Baby, I had a good time, and yes I pop strings
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don’t condone it, love is a component
You’re the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give me time
Said I won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

She growing up aight
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I, I just didn’t think I wasn’t good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I’d get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that
I wasn’t going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren’t perfect
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it’s like he’s perfect and he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition</div>

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, oh

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

Before your love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here (here, here, yeahhh)

I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?  (do you understand?)
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

I can't imagine life without your touch,
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'

I'm gonna hold it down for you
You, whoa, oh, whoa
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah whoa

I don't wanna to go back
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh

Just a fraction of your love fills the air

When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)

To platinum the game's been wrap, one

Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...

Summer days with my honey, worried 'bout not a thing,
Back in the day when things were easier than the breeze...
Who knew that kiss was the last one? I never thought we would change;
Baby, I'm missing you...

Oh, we shoulda been forever, but we fell apart;
Might have separated, but you took my heart...
Always knew I wasn't really over us,
And sometimes, I catch myself...

Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...
You! Yeah... 
Oh...

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing cause time was all we spent...

Oh, we shoulda been forever, but we fell apart;
Might have separated, but you took my heart...
Always knew I wasn't really over us,
And sometimes, I catch myself...

Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...
You! Yeah...
Oh, babe... mm...
Oh, baby... oh, babe...

Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions

Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds, tho
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
How they feel about you, where you're from, where your bed at
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that

You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6 point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci

Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy

You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story
Nah, it don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it
And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart, but she'd never wanna split a ting with me
But when it comes to you, you

Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla

Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too,
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright

Gimme some!

<u>"Yoncé":</u>
See me up in the club with fifty eleven girls;
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill...
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sittin' low,
And every boy in here with me got that smoke,
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down;
All on Instagram, cake by the pound...
Circulate the image every time I come around;
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe...

Brought this all for you, just walk my way...
(Just tell me how it's looking, babe, just tell how it's looking, babe...)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim...
(And tell me how it's looking, babe...) How it's lookin', babe... (Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin' babe...)

Drop the bass - man, the bass get lower;
Radio say speed it up, I just go slower...
High like treble, puffin' on the mids;
No man ain't never seen a booty like this...
And why you think you keep my name rollin' up the tongue?
'Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one...
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker;
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...

Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...

"Beyoncé, Beyoncé?"
"Are you happy to be in Paris? Are you happy to be in Paris?"
"Beyoncé, Beyoncé? Beyoncé!"

<u>"Partition":</u>
Driver, roll up the partition, please...
Driver, roll up the partition, please;
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up;
We ain't even gon' make it to this club...
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged;
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck...
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse;
He Monica Lewinskied all on my gown...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, didn't bring the towel;
Whoa baby, baby, we better slow it down...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like), the kinda girl you like... (Girl you like...)
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...

Driver, roll up the partition fast...
Driver, roll up the partition fast;
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash...
Handprints and footprints on my glass,
Handprints and good grips all on my ass...
Private show, with the music blasting;
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty...
Red wine drip, filth, talk that trash;
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur;
Whoa baby, baby, be sweatin' out my hair...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like), the kinda girl you like... (Girl you like...)
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...

<u>Hajiba Fahmy:</u>
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe? Le sexe. Je veux dire, l’activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça? 
Tu ne t’interesses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c’est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.

<u>Beyoncé:</u>
Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like), the kinda girl you like... (Girl you like...)
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...</div>
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think that I belong to ya
Just too busy running shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretending, stop that fronting
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing
And makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl
And you might feel like nothing was the same

I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

Drinking, smoking, fucking, plotting
Scheming, plotting, scheming, getting money
Drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting, scheming,
Plotting, getting money

This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build and destroy
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
This the shit I wanna go out to
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time 
Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well, I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertaining as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back
But it's hard to think of them polite flows
Mr. fano poloto suits on your night clothes
And jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shits just been light pole
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game u only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camara
Someone gotta tape dis
I make hits and like a bitch
Just married I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness
I'm that close to
Don't ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los angeles, cabanas or atlanta south
Watchin home shows
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarased
To put my phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She said I shouldn't have until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just see my ex-girl
Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear
We from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something dat these lables can't buy
Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul
And still b only tellin tales "damn drake fly"
And he just be like "silly mother fucker I know"
That was your bad
How could you pass up on em?
He just take the records
And he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did pole
At least they try to
And that's what happens
When you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to naww
Before they told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause who of known me would
Mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
Baa into my city I'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and is not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo
So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit
I'm gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in their verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause it's ye shit you better kill
And I think it's got them making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Ain't never real
Yea... that's all I can say
Yes
It's so crazy right now
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young

You ready?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

Get up, history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

[Hook]
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that 
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

[Hook]
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over
<div class="lyricbox">Uh-huh uh-huh (Shia, Rihanna)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Ho)
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain
I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me
In anticipation
For precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay
Rain man is back
With little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come in to me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

It's raining, raining
Ooh baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come in to me
Come in to me
It's raining, raining
Ooh baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come here to me
Come in to me

It's pouring rain, it's pouring rain
Come in to me, come in to me
Come in to me, come in to me</div>
Dear Santa

Away from me

Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace

Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

What happened to the plan we had
I checked the news and it said

Make it go away
See I I really need him to stay
For a couple more days
Can't you make his
Five o'clock flight delay
Won't you find a way

I just have one wish
This year can you

Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

I know I'm asking for the impossible
But I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me
So please, please

Just make it snow in california
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a
You walked in, caught my attention;
I've never seen a man with so much dimension...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,

Now I can't wait to hold you in my arms;
I know I was made for you - I'm in love with all your charm...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;

About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,

And I need you like I never have loved before...
Oh, I want you - ooh, I need you;
Got to have you like I never had lovin' before...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
There's a dream in my soul
A fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
Waiting to be set free

I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it
I can taste it
Change is coming my way

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around (whoa)
This world can make you feel small (whoa)
They will not keep me down (whoa)
I was born to stand tall

I'm goin' all the way
I can feel it, I believe it
I'm here, I'm here to stay

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me

I'll light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of

And this world will belong to me

I was born to be

Fever in the morning

Fever in the evening 
Fever all through the night 
You give me fever, yeah

My baby knows just what to do 
You got me boilin past a hundred and two 
You give me a fever 

Never know how much I love you 
Never know how much I care 
When you put your arms around me 
I get a fever that's so hard to bear 

You give me fever 
When you kiss me and fever when you hold me tight 
In the mornin and fever all through the night 

My baby's so damn sexy 
My baby put the fever on me 
My baby knows just what to do 
And got boilin me past a hundred and two 
Give me a fever 

Everybody's got a fever 
That is somethin you all know 
Fever isn't such a new thing 
Fever started long ago 

Romeo loved Juliet 
And Juliet felt the same 
When he put his arms around her 
He said Julie baby you're my flame 
Thou give me fever 
When we kisseth 
A fever with the flaming youth 
Fever I'm on fire 
Fever yea I burn forsooth 

Captain Smith and Pocahontas 
Had a very mad affair 
When her daddy tried to kill him 
She said Daddy, oh don't you dare 
He gives me fever 
With his kisses 
Fever when he holds me tight 
Fever 
I'm his Mrs. 
And Daddy won't you treat him right 

Now that you've listened to my story 
Here's the point that I have made 
Chicks were born to give ya fever 
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade 
They give ya fever 
When ya kiss em 
Fever if you live ya learn 
Fever until you sizzle 
What a lovely way to burn 
Fever 
Til ya sizzle 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely to... burn 

Fever
There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts that had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I could not undo
Some things I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
When life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past 'cause it's gone
And you gotta just move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned

From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Chorus:
I gotta make it out, or move quickly, cant allow the past to restrict me,
But this time around they wont skip me, I AM THE LAST HOPE, dont hesitate
Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,
Im on the front line, so my weapon, I AM THE LAST HOPE.

Kardinall:
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ,
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that martin lurther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die .
I was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas .
T-dot mutherfucker watch the world rape us .
Great test strugglers hustler to us succeed .
Cross water smugglers tussel to burn weed .
It meets that pressure to success in the south.
Niggas watchin what i say magnifin my mouth .
I never take back talk i apply the force . 
Hand blistering for many years of holding the torch . 

When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher then leather , 
So we can keep on hold it forever . 
My names kardinall

Chorus:
I gotta make it out, or move quickly, cant allow the past to restrict me,
But this time around they wont skip me, I AM THE LAST HOPE, don't hesitate
Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,
Im on the front line, so my weapon, I AM THE LAST HOPE.

Drake:
Jealousy is suttin i haven't felt in years . there's nobody around for me to be jealous off . i bet you do is showing my city and no one cheers even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove . im incredible often unforgettable but when it comes to records i will eat it if its editable . they say the futures always for-seen thats why im steady getting more money more cream . my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before a dream i stay avoiding unlucky like 14 . and people get behind and they fight for em cause he wont let no other niggas wright for em . and even when its quite warm the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm . the name's drake and i don't take it for granted i can take it you offended cause im taken advantage mang . 

Chorus:
I gotta make it out, or move quickly, cant allow the past to restrict me,
But this time around they wont skip me, I AM THE LAST HOPE, don't hesitate
Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession,
Im on the front line, so my weapon, I AM THE LAST HOPE.
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out.

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

[Repeat Chorus]
So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
Even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Bridge]
Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah you hurt me but I learned alot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)

[Repeat Chorus]
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh)
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) woo woo (woo woo)

Yeah
[Bridge]
Now I've got me, myself and I (I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If ya cried a thousand times ladies you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through (After all the rain you'll see the sun come again)
You're set in stone and I never give in 
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening 
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that 
I think you're giving off way too much in fact 
I say we've only known each other one year 
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer my dear"

You like to be so close, I like to be alone 
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor 
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do 
But we do, but we do, but we do

I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more 
I've never known this inevitable 
You're the first to make out whenever we are two 
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you 
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative 
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combined 
You think we would and we do, but we do, but we do, but we do 

Favouritism ain't my thing but 
In this situation I'll be glad

Favouritism ain't my thing but
I'll be glad to make an exception

You're set in stone and I never give in 
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening 
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving off way too much in fact 
I say we've only known each other one year 
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer my dear"

You like to be so close, I like to be alone 
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor 
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
Yeah B,
Talk your mess
Partner let me upgrade you
How you gon' upgrade me
What's higher than number 1
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block
Partner let me upgrade you

I hear you be the block
But I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a
Leash though

Yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah

Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, no

I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love, I want it I crave it
I just can't get enough

Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I've been let down but never been tainted
So I stay thirsty for more
No I won't hold back no drop is wasted
I let love run it's cours

Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

I'm so intoxicated
I learned the way you taste
On my lips when we kiss

You got me so addicted
So much I can't resist
Falling into your arms

Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah

You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

It's all that I need

[Rihanna]

Meet me at the top (top, top)
It's gettin' lonely

Who think they test me now
Run through yo town
I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million

And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that

I can't just let you run up on me like that (all on me like that)
Yeahhh

So I think I betta let ya know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
A yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

[Jeezy]
Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red doors get a block back to the presidents
I used to run my old block like Obama did
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then

Couldn't even come in my room
Smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag
They try to clone me

You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames,
Louis belt
What that make me
Louis Mane

I'm in the all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They ain't hard as this

Hard!
One word describes me
And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard

[Rihanna]
Where them girls talkin' trash
Where they at, where they at, where they at

Where them bloggers at
Where they at, where they at, where they at

Where ya lighters at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
A yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I
[Drake]
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven't slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I'm single...
Thinking 'bout what we had and missing you
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me
Eat your muthafuckin heart out, it's Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I'm good...
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed
I promise to stay the same

[Young Jeezy]
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest

[Chorus]
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doing my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

[Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life ya'll say fo'ever
Its hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest you're gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names Young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'm gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly i need feathers
Same shit in the streets so what's the dealy? 
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for ya'll to meet the love of my life her names THE GAME

[Young Jeezy]
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I'm the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest

[Chorus]
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

Yeah, Uhuh

[Verse 1-Drake]
Uh hardly home but always reppin' 
You hardly on &amp; always second 
When I'm awake, you always resting
And when they call you, 
The answer you will hardly question 
I...I'm doing classic shit in all my sessions 
Other niggas situations they are all depressin 
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions 
I just always did my own thing 
Now I run the game.. you stupid mothasuckas 
I see all this 'Money' through my ohio state 'Buck'-eyes 
Shit been going good, but good could turn to better 
Cuz you the type to lose her, &amp; I'm about to get her 

(Hook-Drake) 
It's okay x6 
You could run &amp; tell ya friends that I'm on 
I'm on x5 
Best believe I understand 
It's okay x5 
You could run &amp; tell my city I'm on 
I'm on x5 
You could run &amp; tell my city it's on 

[Verse 2-Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one way 
Women don't get saved round me, even on a Sunday 
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wondered who 
Then they meet my pop &amp; tell 'em "Drake is just a younger you" 
And shawty wanna party, so don't let ya girl up out the house 
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin her mouth to mouth 
Now she's famous &amp; the paparazzi starts to shoot her 
I dropped to black cards, I named 'em Malcolm X &amp; Martin Luther 
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady 
They just used to 'Love', those are 'Tennis' games lady 
Have you counting money going duffel bag crazy 
Sippin on Pink Floyd &amp; puffin Wayne Brady 
Damn... Whose Line Is It anyways? 
I'm in a daze 
You been amazed 
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage 
I'm on fire, yep I been ablaze 
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right 
You look nice &amp; your frame makes me wanna bowl a strike 
Well alright 
Guess I might... know what? Fuck it 
Yes I will 
I am more that what you bargained for, nothin less than real 
Put it to ya like...... 

[Hook]
It's okay x6 
You could run &amp; tell ya friends that I'm on 
I'm on x5 
Best believe I understand 
It's okay x5 
You could run &amp; tell my city I'm on 
I'm on x5 
You could run &amp; tell my city it's on 

[Verse 3-Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill also one of the dopest 
Rep for the streets or on the mic I'm dope &amp; yes I'm focused 
The gangsta recognize me for my locc'ness 
No joke..it's..time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust 
Or maybe like a py-Thon 
That's the type of shit I'm-on 
I wrote this on my I-Phone 
So let me drop this I-bomb 
I-palm the game like it's a Spalding ball-&amp; take flight 
From the free throw line &amp; slam it down like I'm the great mike 
Bun &amp; Wayne &amp; Drake in here, mayne it's gon be a great night 
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white 
Try to cross me over, I just fake left then I break right 
Stupid animal tricks like David Lettermans Late Night 
This that major moment you been waitin on for too long 
The best that ever did it &amp; doing it on a new song 
UGK &amp; Young Money, too strong 
Bound to be in the green like a crouton 
So what the fuck is you on?? 

[Hook]
It's okay x6 
You could run &amp; tell ya friends that I'm on 
I'm on x5 
Best believe I understand 
It's okay x5 
You could run &amp; tell my city I'm on 
I'm on x5 
You could run &amp; tell my city it's on 

[Verse 4-Lil' Wayne] 
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all American bad boy 
I own the swagger super market, &amp; you, you just a bag boy 
Cuz I got that swag boy 
The swag you never had boy 
Hate &amp; I will leave your chest the color my flag boy 
Suu Woo bitch I do this shit 
I'll erase you like I drew you bitch

[Drake verse 1]
Responsible for everything you listen to

Took over my city and I never asked permission to
Started popping bottles 'cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate it by law fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing dropping and these bitches wanna snow blow and 
They just give me head while the haters give me promoooo
And man my DJ shoulda won that but listen and respect man the city Owe us one back

Shout goes out to Teddy muthafucka I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, ex girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickering
I tried to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'll take a minute if you're listening,
Please start doin' you,

And I'm a staple in my city you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewing me
But I got love for everybody,

Even if you're suing me
My brother P. Ray knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil' Wayne show

And fuck you if you had me,
Shout goes out to Brian E.,

I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational

Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO unruly

With my woes
I'm taking over my body
Back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
"T"s uncrossed and "I"s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot
Like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, swat

I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

And I'll be holding on to you

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me"

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith



Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gunna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

And I'll be holding on to you



And you got me like oh
What you want from me?
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby you got me like oh, mm
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together
And throw me against the wall

Baby you got me like aaah, woo, aaah
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just stop loving me (loving me), babe

Oh, and babe I'm fist fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe?
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Then you keep loving me
Just love me, yeah
Just love me
All you need to do is love me yeah
Got me like ah-ah-ah-ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart?

Baby like aaah, woo, aaah
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just stop loving me (loving me), babe

Oh, and babe I'm fist fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe?
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain
Southern Smoke!!!

[Speaking]
Yeah. Ho! 
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

[Chorus:]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1:]
Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw,
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more 
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Chorus: (x2)]
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2:]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

[Chorus: (x2)]
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Outro: (x2)]
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance,
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

[Talking]
Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters
Drake, It's Southern Smoke
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow

So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking

Now I'm all singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
That tells 'em my life is too much and moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

I always up too late I worry bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady

I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money I'm still young and just unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose

I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?
<div class="lyricbox">You're beautiful, beautiful
You should know it
You’re beautiful, beautiful
I think it’s time, think it’s time that you show it
You’re beautiful, beautiful
Go, go, go
Baby watcha doin'?
Where you at, where you at?
Why you acting so shy?
Holding back, holding back
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, like that
So DJ bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

'Cause all around the world
People want to be loved, yeah
'Cause all around the world,
They’re no different than us
All around the world
People want to be loved

People want to be loved
They’re no different than us

Yeah
Once again
All around the world
Dynamic duos are back
JB, Luda
I love everything about you
You’re imperfectly perfect
Everyone’s itching for beauty
But just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found
Can the DJ please reverse it
In life we pay for change
Let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles
But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

All around the world
People want to be loved, yeah
They’re no different than us
(All around the world)
People want to be loved
All around the world
(All around the world)
They’re no different then us
All around the world
(All around the world)
People want to be loved
All around the world
(All around the world)
They're no different than us
All around the world</div>

I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

On the eve of a day
That's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don't need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
'Cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There's something we need

I'm not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you what I'm sing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore
And that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'm sorry
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with this dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control

If I could give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need it

I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out the trenches, I really made it
I came out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private cause lately out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I jug and get it

I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money man, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control

I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mayor comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro Boom make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change

I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with this dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
<div class="lyricbox">Beyoncé
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'm a wall, come and march on the regular
Painting white flags blue

Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'mma rain, I'mma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'mma wade, I'mma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof

Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Beyoncé
Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Kendrick Lamar
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out

I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to cool myself off
I was served lemons, but I made lemonade</div>
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you, dear?
Is there anyone I could call?
No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Justin Bieber
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Tyga
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than its gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
That I thought
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment

Justin Bieber
Now Romeo &amp; Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie &amp; Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do

You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't
I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam &amp; Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny &amp; Cher
I don't care
I got you baby

See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
(Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
(And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security

Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall
The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what I'm supposed to do

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

In my head we're already together
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Should I tell her, how I really feel
Or should I moving closer just be still
How would I know?
Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same?

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Catching feelings, catching feelings
Come on over here, lay down next to me, let me tell you something
That I've been meaning to say for a long time
Baby it's been some time since we first met
And every day with you is like no other

All this love you're giving me
I know just what to do
I'll take the love you're giving me
And give my love to you

You give your love so freely and you give it so abundantly
I just want to be able to give it back to you
Come on baby let me tell you, tell you all the things I feel
'Cause if it wasn't for your love, oh yeah
I don't think I would know what's real

All this love you're giving me
I know just what to do
I'll take the love you're giving me
And give my love to you

You got me singing
La, la, la

You got me singing
La, la, la

All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
I'm loving all this love you're giving me

I'm loving all this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you

I'm loving all this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you

I wanna give, just let me give it back to you

Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy

He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed 

And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her

The coach said, "Hey son, what's your problem? 
Tell me, have you lost your mind?" 
Daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy, you better tell her goodbye!"

But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American...

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want?" 
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know... 
Sweet little beautiful, one just like you.
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American..."

Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl 
Oh, American girl
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Somethin spinnin fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if ya ears a virgin id advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't couchere and this shit isn't christian
It's that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen
Girl holla at yo nigga I got that shit for low
Ok maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride ya'll
We all of age and I ain't got nothin to hide ya'll
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

[Hook:]
Every record that I've done the station hear em play it
This the city that I run this the shit that I created
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearin thangs cause I'm feelin like I'm faded

I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded

[Rihanna]
Ecstasy... in the air
I don't care, can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired, the worst for wear
'Cause...

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

Can't you say...
Ain't it clear, I don't care
Get closer to me...
If you dare
I double dare
'Cause...

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

[Eminem]
I'm blasted! (Drywall!) Look me in my eyeball!
Do I look high? (No!)
I love the way you lie girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come here dear, I'm trying to get closer to you

I'm motioning you to pull over you boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police, and I'm looking at your REAR, REAR, REAR!
But odds are, Imma end up in the back of a squad car

By the end of tonight
I'm a rock star, get your wind up
It's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are?

Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt, every thought scarred
Got my pants off at the sidewalk, and crosswalks and suspenders
And I can't feel my lips (be)cause...

[Rihanna]
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me, I don't know where to start;
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I love you more than anything, but the words can't even touch what's in my heart...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) No, no... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

When I try to explain it, I'd be sounding insane;
The words don't ever some out right...
I get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)
And I say, "Baby, baby..." (Whoa, whoa...) "Baby..."

(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)
Baby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...)

Baby, I'm so down for you, no matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around;
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Oh, baby...
See, baby, I've been feeling you before I even knew what feelings were about...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Oh, baby... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

When I try to explain it, I'd be sounding all crazy;
Words don't ever come out right...
I get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)
And I say, "Baby, baby..." (Whoa, whoa...) "Baby..."

(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, (baby,)
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)
Baby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...)

Straight up, you got me all in, how could I not be? I sure hope you know... (I sure hope you know...)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word "love" can say it - it's better not explaining,
That's why I keep saying "Baby, I..."

(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it...)
Baby, baby... (Ooh, oh, oh...) Baby... (Baby, baby...)

(Baby I!)  Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
(But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it,)
(Every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it,)
Every time I try to say it, words can only complicate it...
Baby, baby... (Whoa, whoa...) Baby, baby...
<div class="lyricbox">You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a, not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game
This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun

You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?

Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
You can’t take no L’s off me
I know you been...

Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Don't mean that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When were in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over</div>
I told you how you hurt me, baby, but you don't care;
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby, but you don't care...
Can't nobody tell me this is love, when you're immune to all my pain;
I need you to tell me this is love - You don't care, well, that's okay...

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry, 
And now, every time our love goes sour, you won't sympathize...
You see these tears fallin' down to my ears - I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah;
I try to tell you all my fears, huh! You still don't care - that's okay...

Hey... well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care... Yeah...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Boy, maybe if you cared enough, I wouldn't have to care so much...
What happened to our trust? Now you're just givin' up;
You used to be so in love - now you don't care no more!

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la,la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Daddy was mean ol' mister, mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister, she prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar, listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter, she called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
(Blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away

Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away

[Verse 1:]
Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you read a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know

[Verse 2:]
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know

[Hook:]
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can't you see
It's the way it's gotta be

[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Yeah
I know
I told ya
Baby

Uh, uh
I told ya, baby
Uh oh

Uh oh
I told ya, baby

Uh oh
I told ya, baby
I told ya

With my white jacket on
Wont you come

Lala lala lala lala, oh
You know, I never felt like this before
Just feels like somethin' real

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question and you're, of course, the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you, I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock

Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making (Y-O-U) this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

SOS please somebody help me, yeah
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it (all of the time)
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me (best of me), so now I'm losing it

Lala lala lala lala, oh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala
Oh oh oh
[Slakah:]
Lady, You Say I Stay In The House Til Four
We don't Even Go Out No More
It's Always The Same Eh
Always Complainin
It's Obvious Baby
I Guess You don't Watch The News
You See there's A Lot To Lose
Cuz We Got A Baby
And People Are Shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My Generation Is Changin
Aside From The Fact
The Dealers Have Customers They Provide With The Crack
Front Of The Buses Taken
And We Denied From The Back
You Can Die Where From, Or Die Where You At

[Drake Chorus]
Don't Put It Past Them
I don't Think That They Understood
My Friends They don't Even Sit In The Class When They Should
He Can Come Pick You Up
If Your Dads In The Hood
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good

[Slakah:]
Lady, Somebody Shot Up The Place Right By
Where I Work And I Think They Might
Be Coming For Me Next
Lend Me Ya Kleenex
I'm Tellin You Baby
I Think I'm A Bout To Cry
Still Gotta Go Out Tonight
Cuz I Gotta Feed You
I Hope That I See You Again... Again
Hope That I See You, See You

[Chorus: Drake]
Don't Put It Past Them
I don't Think That They Understood
My Friends They don't Even Sit In The Class When They Should
He Can Come Pick You Up
If Your Dads In The Hood
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good

[Verse: Drake]
Lately I don't Know About The Friends That I Hang With
I'm Nervous Round My Boys, It Depends On Their Anguish
Depends On If They Saving All The Tops On Pepsi
With Dreams Of Seeing Girls Topless On Jet Skis
Depends On What They Do To Achieve That
Robbing R&amp;B Singers, 'specially If They Know Where The Keys At
'Specially If They Know Where They Girl Live
Get The Info, Leave With Ya Money Man, that's How The World Is

That's How Niggas Puttin They Dirt Down
Streets Are Seedy I Call Em Sesame... Berkstown
'Specially When These Young'ns Get Turned Down For Work Opportunities
Next Week Same Place'll Get Burnt Down
Coincidink? Not Likely Not A Chance
How Can We Be So Aware Of These Problems And Not Advance?
At Least Start Put A Bid In, it's Hard Just To Fit In
A Lot Of People Only Play They Part When They Spittin
But I don't Think That They Understood
They Using This Darkness For Penetration In The Hood
I Took The Ivory Way In And Yes I'm Glad That Keenan Could
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good

Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good
So girl
You just be honest with me, I know we can make this work
I love you

I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all, give it all to you

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Only wanna live it with you

Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it happen, [?]
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than a mission

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all, give it all to you

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Only wanna live it with you

If I came to your crib would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Only wanna live it with you
[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Hook]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Hook]
[Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica]
You're so hot (not?)
But if I can be honest
Baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool (not?)
But if you didn't notice
You got me playing a fool
With you
Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way

You're so... you (ew, grows)
But there's something about ya
It's making me feel like I do
With you
Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be true
We will
I'm all about you
If it's real
You got me sick
Cause I'm not letting go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way.
Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride
Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them

I am cold, can you hear
I will fly, with no hope, no fear
And the ground, taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing

All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing, remind us of things that no body cares about
And honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free

I am cold, can you hear
I will fly, with no hope, no fear
And the ground, taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I

I am cold, can you hear
I will fly, with no hope, no fear
And the ground, taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I

How frustrating, and so degrading
His time, we're wasting
And time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading
And he is waiting, oh so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
Please think about why you can't sleep in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine
Come and kiss me, baby - we don't need no mistletoe, mm;
We don't need no fireplace - boy, I'll keep you nice and warm, hey...
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies? Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy,
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play...

'Tis the season for some love giving,
So I think you should give your love to me...
Baby, let me know...

Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know...)
Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas?

We don't need no presents, we don't need the kitchen, we don't need them recipes;
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread, made with love...
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies? Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy,
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play...

'Tis the season for some love giving,
So I think you should give your love to me...
Baby, let me know...

Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know...)
Are you wit it? Are you wit it? Are you wit it this Christmas?

Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space, and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
You've got me
You've got me speechless

Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say
Yes, yes, yes, 
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless
Rihanna:
On the first page of our story, the future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil, I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes, and you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero, even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh-oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices, glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win, even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand, with violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles, are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, oh-oh, I love the way you lie, oh-oh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

Eminem:
It's morning, you wake a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me

Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby without you I'm nothing, I'm so lost hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me

Then after that shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky

Together we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah but who's counting?!
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain

Our love is crazy we're nuts, but I refuse counselling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you I'm out it

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Sitting on my bed with just your t-shirt on
 Turning up the volume to my favorite song
 Boy I can't lie
 What we did last night
 You know it's constantly replaying, staying on my mind

 I'll show you what I like boy boy boy,
 If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
 I'll show you what I like,
 Show you what I like like,
 If you show me what you like boy

 If I had a choice
 If I had my way
 Boy you know we'd do it every single day
 If I had a wish
 And if I had my way
 Boy you know we'd do it every single day

 Damn
 Wish I didn't feel so hypnotized,
 But when I look at you baby it's justified,
 So I take what I want,
 And give what I got,
 To help with all the rules that keep us civilized

 I'll show you what I like boy boy boy,
 If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
 I'll show you what I like,
 Show you what I like like,
 If you show me what you like boy

 If I had a choice
 If I had my way
 Boy you know we'd do it every single day
 If I had a wish
 And if I had my way
 Boy you know we'd do it every single day

 No where I'd rather be
 Than anywhere alone, just you and me
 I'll be your Tonto, you'll be my Clyde
 We'll be together forever we'll ride
 I want you more and more
 You're hotter today than the day before
 No lie, no lie, no lie, no lie

 If I had a choice
 If I had my way
 Boy you know we'd do it every single day
 If I had a wish
 And if I had my way
 Boy you know we'd do it every single day

 I'll show you want I like boy boy boy,
 If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
 I'll show you what I like,
 Show you what I like like,
 If you show me what you like boy

When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
To hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Eerything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

Let me show what it is
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap

Ooo wee
Took 'em from white snakes to
Ooo wee
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but
Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us 
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Chillin with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince he rep two up two down
Anyone I know get used to me
Im far from the man that I used to be 
I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providing that
Understand that I'm worldwide
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK
From Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans
But yo this hook is for my exes

This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show you're face
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Don't ever mistake it

Girl my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you 
You had a chance now It's gone
Oooooh
You had a man now you don't 
Back to the basics
I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly
Lookin for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life
Tryin to find another one tonight
And if it's you baby
Let yourself be seen

Dresses or jeans
I got that work
Know what I mean
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean

This one is for you girl

'Cause you know that I'm a star girl

Check this out
from the that she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement

This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show you're face
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Don't ever mistake it

Girl my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you 
You had a chance now It's gone
Oooooh
You had a man now you don't 
Back to the basics
I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

Su-woop to the (whoa oh oh ohh)
<div class="lyricbox">I remember when you use to take me on a 
Bike ride everyday on the bayou (You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong 
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you 
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

Because you loved me I overcome
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face 
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
Men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Can't help my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you, daddy.)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy</div>

You've been on my mind, I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go, you're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

If I've been on your mind, you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go? 

I don't know why I'm scared, 'cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it, nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

Down from your dark hiding place 
Go ahead and show me 
Your face 

Rain down 
And destroy me

I am simply very perplexed 
By your ways

Use your name? 

Rain down 
And destroy me

[Drake:]
Whos that peeking in my window? uh
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info,
We can work it out no nintendo
I just hit ALT-TAB
Switchin in between two convos
I should just call, cabs
And bring them both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose the connection
Cause I remember Stacey, she prolly hate me,
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that sh*t I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to aim me
She stayed up late, she used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even photoshop couldn't change me
But you, you, you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even trying to settle so why try?
Ended the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched your love is so wi-fi

Girl girl girl girl girl girl
Shes Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl

[Jamie Foxx:]
My homies never see
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my louis computer bag
Wherever you are I could be
I type you messages for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Shes Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
(Ooh, she is my) My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl

[The-Dream:]
Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind shawty
Your Donna Karan underwear, baby
I wanna see what's under there, baby

[Kanye West:]
When you take the picture cut off your face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'm a hit home plate
Wait would this be considered our first date
Yay the pictures just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And playboy mags like Stacey Dash
And playboy mags like Stacy Dash
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls would make you wait longer than A. C. Green
Passion of the Christ, 33 year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck
I hear the way the text say
Baby you up
Question mark
And she respond yes-s-s-I-r

[Outro: The-Dream And Jamie Foxx]
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Boy, you'll be the death of me;
You're my James Dean - You make me feel like I'm seventeen...
You drive too fast, you smoke too much,
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)

You know, I've been in love before;
You're the first one I ever seen that burns like gasoline...
So light a match, turn off the lights;
I'm holdin' on to you, 'cause this might be our last night, oh...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)

What I'm tellin' you: I'm givin' you my life, it's in your hands,
And what I'm gonna do is be a woman, and you can be a man,
And I wanna say nobody understands what we been through;
I rather give up everything than to live my, live my life without you...

All!

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
Only if for a night
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfections
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
and that's exactly what I mean.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
I look at you, and all I wanna do, is just disappear
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get out of here
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know my heart

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover,
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

Sitting here all alone
Watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days
We threw them snowballs

I'm putting the tree up by myself

And nobody else

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
'Cause I need to here

Wrapping gifts without you babe
Starting in December and there's no call

I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again

And I don't care
If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now

And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that
All I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas
This Christmas, all I want is you

I looked in my rearview mirror, (ahhh) and it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah...
I'm ready to make that turn, before we both crash and burn,
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us...

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies? Guess they didn't count at that stop sign,
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light...
Hey, right when I think that we found it, well, that's when we start turnin' around;
You're saying "Baby, don't worry," but we're still going the wrong way...

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love;
Well, they must've been talking about us,
And sometimes, I feel like we've been here before...
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right...
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight;
Honey, I know we can find our way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, my baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in....
Traffic - I'm under...
Pressure... pressure...
Let's just go back to the way it was...

When we were on (Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, 
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue...)
(Avenue...) Let's just go back...
I don't wanna fall, fall away 
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away 

I disguise 
And I will lie 
And I will take my precious time 
As the days spent away 
As I stand in line 
And I die as I wait as I wait on my crime 
And I'll try to delay what you make of my life 
But I don't want your way, 
I want mine 
I'm dying and trying 
But believe me I'm fine 
But I'm lying, 
I'm so very far from fine 

And I can feel the pull begin 
I feel my conscience wearing thin 
And my skin 
It will start to break up and fall apart 

I don't wanna fall, fall away 
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away 

Every time I feel selfish ambition 
Is taking my vision 
And my crime is my sentence 
Repentance is taking commission 
It's taking a toll 
On my soul 
I'm screaming submission and, 
I don't know if I am dying or living 
'Cause I will save face 
For name's sake 
Abuse grace 
Take aim to obtain a new name 
And a newer place 
But my name is lame 
I can't walk and I ain't the same 
And my name became 
A new destiny to the grave 

And I, I can feel the pull begin 
Feel my conscience wearing thin 
And my skin, 
It will start to break up and fall apart 

I don't wanna fall, fall away 
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
I got a house, but I need new furniture,
Why spend mine when I could spend yours

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me, make me, make me cry
Oh Lord, if I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet when I'm already on my knees

'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me how
You think you're gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep comin' around
Creepin' up my street, but boy, you can't bother me

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all rolls through
I ain't gonna raise my body 'til there ain't no sign
'Til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign of you

'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is 

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Oh, don't knock on my door
Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
I, I'm terrified but I'm not leaving (No No)
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me speechless

Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say
Yes, yes, yes, 
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless
<div class="lyricbox">Now you finally tell me how you feel;
Guess your words just came a little too late...
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill;
Don’t be mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced - know your place!

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it’d be different - if you spoke, I would’ve listened, but now I'm with somebody else...
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

Now it’s probably hard for you to hear,
But there’s nothing left for you to say...
Had my heart all in your hands - boy, what you don’t understand
Is a girl like me don’t have no time to waste around...

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it’d be different - if you spoke, I would’ve listened, but now I'm with somebody else...
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

(You’ll never know...) Boy, you should’ve told me, told me...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you should’ve let me know...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve been there for me,
But now, you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

It’s not my fault you’re a little bit too late;
You’re the only one to blame - Wipe that look off your face...
You can wish a thousand times, but none of that will change my mind, boy;
You had a chance you’ll never get back, get back...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know... oh, baby!

(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve told me, told me...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve let me know...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve been there for me...
But now, you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

(You’ll never know...) You will never know, you will never know, oh, baby...
(You’ll never know...) No...
(You’ll never know...)
You will never know! Ooh...</div>
La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la...

I've never been so caught up, still so into us;
I never thought I'd be here - should've turned to dust...
Ooh, let's be honest, baby: this is so unusual;
Ooh, and I'm not tempted, baby, even if they're beautiful...

I used to be cautious, a little too reckless,
Now all my emotions are all cause of you...

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes, I ain't even think of letting go;
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere, I don't even see it down the road...
Cause we're collecting moments, tattoos on my mind;
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes, I ain't even think of letting go,
Not even sometimes...

La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la...

Ooh, let's be honest, baby: this is so unusual;
Ooh, and I'm not tempted, baby, even if they're beautiful...

It used to be easy for someone to steal me;
Now all my emotions are all cause of you, boy...

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes, I ain't even think of letting go;
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere, I don't even see it down the road...
'Cause we're collecting moments, tattoos on my mind;
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes, I ain't even think of letting go,
Not even sometimes, babe...

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why it never worked, but it's going to now;
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know what it does to me when I feel you around...
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear? But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there,
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there, hard to breathe... when you're not here...

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes, (I ain't even think of letting go;)
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere, I don't even see it down the road...
'Cause we're collecting moments, tattoos on my mind,
(And I ain't even think of leaving sometimes, I ain't even think of letting go,)
Ooh yeah, baby, not even sometimes...

[La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la...] Not even sometimes...
[La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la...]
'Cause we're collecting moments, tattoos on my mind, baby!
(And I ain't even think of leaving) sometimes, (I ain't even think of letting go,) No way!
Not even sometimes...

(La, la-la, la-la, la, la...) Not even sometimes, not even sometimes...
(La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la...)
If you search for tenderness, it isn't hard to find;
You can have the love you need to live...
But if you look for truthfulness, you might just as well be blind -
It always seems to be so hard to give...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can always find someone to say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve...
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies;
All I want is someone to believe...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can find a lover, I can find a friend;
I can have security until the bitter end...
Anyone can comfort me with promises again, I know...

When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned;
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone...
But when I want sincerity, tell me, where else can I turn,
When you're the one that I depend upon?

-esty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard;
Mostly what I need from you...
Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too,
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular (?) they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim

(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

(VERSE 2:)
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out"

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh -
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like "Oh well, this is life, I guess." Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't feel like, you give up
Your heart's done
Your love's done
Don't give up
Don't fake it
Don't have to...
Satellites flashing by...

It's a beautiful state we're in, but how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try...

We're nothing like we seem - passionate words are never spoken;
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side...

In your eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

Take all the rules away - how can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display - let's run and hide...

In our eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space...
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe...

Satellites flashing by...
Satellites...
The sun is setting
And you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing
But we won't be watching tonight

Every look (every look)
Every touch (every touch)
Makes me want to give you my heart (ooooooh)
I'll be crashing on you, baby
Stay right where you are, cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
Till the night I held you
You are my moonlight, ohooh
Moonlight

I kiss his finger tips
As a wish and he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis
With some James Dean in his eyes
Put's his lips on my neck
Makes me want to give him my body
I'll be falling for you, baby
And I just can't stop, cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
Till the night I held you
You are my moonlight, ohooh
Moonlight

Baby, I'll be falling
You're my moonlight, ohooh
Moonlight

He's so bossy
He makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When he's holdin' me tight
And he calls me moonlight too
<div class="lyricbox">Nine... four... eight... one. 
B'Day.

Hey!</div>
Some say
I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew

I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you've left behind

Wake me up
Wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified
I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb? 
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I am willing to take the risk

There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart, then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust, but nothing will ever taint us

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I am willing to take the risk

Will he
Will he still remember me? 
Will he still love me even when he's free? 
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me? 

When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
He's willing to take the risk

So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
We're willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is? 
I'm willing to take the risk

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December 
You left my heart a mess (A mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it? (Do it)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

But Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Thought we belong together 
At least that's what you said
Should've known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it?

But Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Ooooo yeeah
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning 
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it?

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

This is our Last (Last) Last (Last) Christmas.
You broke my heart
Last (Last) Last (Last) Christmas
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special.

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December 
You left my heart a mess (A mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it? (Do it)
(Chorus:)
Something bout the way that you workin me,
teasin me, pleasing me, easily boy, I'm addicted to you
Got a have ya for all the things that u do
It something bout this feeling, it's crazy,
amazing that stays with me all night and day,
Makes my temperature rise
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like i'm captured by the touch of your hand
Its so vibe it's your style it the way the that u smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, its electric, this felling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried ??

(Chorus:)
You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin' but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast i'm a afraid can't escape there's no way
Never had a feeling like this b4

(Chorus:)
It's amazing how u drive me crazy
Boy keep doin' what you're doin'
Cause you're really gettin through to me
Day and night babe u know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and u know u got me hypnotized

(Chorus:)
Found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Oh nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became a remedy

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

How I missed you, my love
She says she met me on a tour
She keeps knocking on my door,
she won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong

'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, Maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines, on tv, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie girl
When ain't I never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You throw this, you throw this
Your foolness, seduces

Maria why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl
Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me 
So scratch my itch and beat my drum 
So i can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ooh
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

If you know how to be my lover, maybe you can be my baby;
Hold me close under the cover, kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy...
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby;
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy...

If you know how to treat me, you know how to touch me,
Maybe then you'll get your chance, a chance to love me...
It's obvious I wanna be into you,
But it all depends on all the things you do,
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise,
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest,
You can get anything you want, that you want, babe;
Just show me everything I need to see, I'll give you everything, boy!

If you know how to be my lover, maybe you can be my baby;

Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy...

I'll give you all of my trust if you don't mess this up;
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club...
All you got is eyes for me;
I'm the only girl you see...
So if you treat me right, just the way that I want to,
Oh baby boy, I promise that I'll be on you,
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-on you;
Night to the mo-oh-oh-oh-oh-orning!

(What the heart wants...)
(The heart wants...)

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby...
Hello? Yeah I just walked in.
Yeah I'm good... you still working?
Tonight, right now? Did I go out? Yeah I went out.
I went... I went to a couple of clubs.
I never went to bed, shit... wine or water?
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that imma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
And I'll start hating only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that imma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
And I'll start hating only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor till it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in

I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, "Well I'm sorry."

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
And I'll start hating only if you make me

You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "You niggas crazy."
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
<div class="lyricbox">Happy birthday. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it. 
Believing in what she say'll have you livid. 
Know they won't be happy 'til our love is over. 
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it. 

They ain’t ever had trust like how we got it. 
They ain't never had a chance how you got it. 
So they can't help but to come and hate on it. 
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 

It's like you're always looking for a problem. 
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em. 
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'. 
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em. 

They ain’t ever had trust like how we got it. 
They ain't never had a chance how you got it. 
So they can't help but to come and hate on it. 
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 

She texts me "How's you love life?" and "How are you?", I said "I'm good". 
They only get as close as you allow them to. 
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather. 
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever. 
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer. 
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me. 
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place. 
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home. 
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42. 
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you. 
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape. 
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight. 
Esco. 

You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are.</div>

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

I'm evil to the core
What I shouldn't do, I will
They say I'm emotional
What I want to save, I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?
I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

I'm not evil to the core
What I shouldn't do, I will fight
I know I'm emotional
What I want to save, I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

Yeah, I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
I thought that things like this get better with time, but I still need you... Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind, so I still see you around...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
Said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right, but I still mean them... Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to... Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away... (But you're away...)
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
Wooaah

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine

Oh oh, for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, 'cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
'Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And you shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm 16 and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone
So far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong
We were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favorite song
She was wrong
I am gone
I thought I loved her
Never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover
But now until another like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah)

Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All our feelings tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems

Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating em, splitting em up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out

Domingo en fuego

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh 
On A star 

And I'm wishing on a star 
To follow where you are 
I'm wishing on a dream 
To follow what it means 
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
I wish on all the people who really dream 
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes. 
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done 
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be 
So far away from home 
So far away from me 
Just think of all the moments that we can spend 
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant 
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know, 
In the game of love, you reap what you sow 

I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby 
When we're together 
Whether or never 
I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby. 
When we're together. 
(Let's get together, baby) 
Whether or never. 

And I'm wishin on a star 
To follow where you are 
And I'm wishing on a dream
Hello 
We haven't talked in quite some time 
I know 
I haven't been the best 
Of sons 
Hello 
I've been traveling in 
The desert of my mind 
And I 
Haven't found a drop 
Of life 
I haven't found a drop 
Of you 
Of water 

I try desperately to run through the sand 
As I hold the water 
In the palm of my hand 
Cuz it's all that I have 
It's all that I need and 
The waves of the water 
Mean nothing to me 
But I try my best 
And all that I can to 
Hold tightly onto 
What's left in my hand 
But no matter how 
How tightly I will strain 
The sand will slow me down 
And the water will drain 
I'm just being dramatic 
In fact, 
I'm only at it again 
As an addict with a pen 
Who's addicted to the wind 
As it blows me back and fourth 
Mindless, spineless, and pretend 
Of course I'll be here again 
See you tomorrow 
But it's the end of today 
End of my ways 
As a walking denial 
My trail was filed as a crazy 
Suicidal head case 
But you specialize in dying 
You hear me screaming 
Father 
And I'm lying here just crying 
So wash me with your water 

Hello 
We haven't talked in quite some time 
I know 
I haven't been the best
Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
I, I'm terrified but I'm not leaving (No No)
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)
[Drake:]
Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[Drake:]
Uh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'm a take this hat off, and I'm a hit it till I backs off
And then I'm back sorrowful
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Chorus]
[Phonte:]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon

[Chorus]
[Elzhi:]
They say you never judge a book by it's cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by it's cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside-down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after, happily

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease
Justin Bieber
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Usher
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
Both
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase (oh wooah)
To kids from one to ninety-two (yeah, yeah)
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas (yeah), Merry Christmas (oh no)
Merry Christmas to you
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now

No more gas, in the red, can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said, can't even speak about it
On my life, on my head, don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)

Faded pictures on the wall, it's like they talking to me
Disconnecting on calls, the phone don't even ring
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind it can control you
I feel like a monster, oh

Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia, disturbia

(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)

Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain but I'm struggling
If you can't go-o-o
I think I'm gonna ah, ah, ah, ah

Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)

I don't know who you think I am

He been gone since three thirty
And coming home, lately at three thirty
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby you gon' get it

Now I ain't tripping (Ah!)
I ain't twisted (Ah!)
I ain't demented (Huh!)
Well, just a lil' bit (Huh!)

I'm kickin' ass
I'm taking names
I'm on flame
Don't come home late

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All night (Uh huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police and lights

Imma fight a man tonight
Imma fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an

I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire

I am getting restless
I am getting testy
And I can't believe he's always out
Every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I am looking round for something else to throw

I'm breakin' dishes
Up in here
All night (Uh huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police and lights (Uh huh)

I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
Ohhhhh

I don't know who you think I am (I am...)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come imma huff and puff
And blow this, blow this whole

Blow this, blow this,
Imma blow this, blow this whole
Blow this house house down!
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes

I'm breakin' dishes
Up in here
All night (Uh huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh huh)

Imma fight a man tonight
Imma fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an

A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an

[TALKING:]
Southern Smoke {echo}
It's Southern Smoke baby! 
(Money) Frank [?]
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[VERSE 1:]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy

So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy! 

[CHORUS:]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, 4 g's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie

[VERSE 2: Nickelus F]
[CHORUS]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right
There's, no need to stash right
Got the same, 4 g's from last night
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around

I guess it's right
It's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)
(Take me to that place you cry from)
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
[Drake:]
Yeah, yeah
Jeez
Yeah
Right
Look

Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But you don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard yo never claimed the hood
Hear the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin'
Yeah, Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lot of sides on the same side
OVO we a gold mine
But I'm going to go no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, Like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city going crazy
Top 5 no debating
Top 5, top 5, top 5
And the whole city rave me
And I'm back inside a matrix
And I said that we'd make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no metal-on-the-way shit
We'd really put some days in

[Future:]
Hey why you so excited? What happened
Did you win the grammy? God damn
You acting like you fucking won a trophy
This nigga turnt the fuck up

They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swerving off, Panoramic
I'm hanging out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showing out, they can't stand me
I'm swerving out, they can't stand me
I'm err, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy

Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a xan niggas
Get pissed off, start airing it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, don't blend in
When I saw that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features or add-ins
I don't want features or nothin
You can't even get on my guest list
They wan't me to go to the met gala
I want a percocet and a gallon
The activis high takin' don't matter
We sitting right on the cortside
I know players on both side
I'm catching out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the poor guys
Black tint low profile
Celebrating everyday cause I'm really really fresh at the coke house
Counting up every single day Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swerving out, Panaramic
I'm hanging out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showing out, they can't stand me
I'm swerving out, they can't stand me
I'm err, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
<div class="lyricbox">Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know</div>
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Wohh ho ho oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Wohh oh oh oh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Wohh ho ho oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
