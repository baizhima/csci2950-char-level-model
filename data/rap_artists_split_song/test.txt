something's wrong, i can feel it <unk> minutes, slim shady, you're on)
just a feeling i've got, like something's about to <unk> but i don't know what
if that means what i think it means, we're in trouble big trouble
and if he is bananas as you say, i'm not taking any chances
you are just what the doctor ordered

i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back <unk> back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to <unk> <unk>
they said i rap like a <unk> so call me <unk>

but for me to rap like a computer must be in my <unk>
i got a <unk> in my back pocket
my <unk> go off when i <unk> it
got a fat knot from that rap profit

made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica <unk> feeling on his <unk>
i'm an mc still as honest

but as rude and <unk> as all hell
syllables <unk> <unk> 'em all <unk>
this <unk>
you don't really wanna get into a <unk> match with this <unk>
packing a mack in the back of the <unk> backpack rap, <unk> <unk>

and now at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical <unk> stunts while i'm practicing that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not <unk> all i do is drop <unk> feel my <unk> of attack
rappers are having a rough time <unk> here's a <unk>
it's actually <unk> bad for the wack
while i'm <unk> <unk> this <unk> yeah

'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back <unk> back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to <unk> <unk>
let me show you <unk> this shit ain't that hard, that hard

everybody want the key and the secret to rap <unk> like i have got
well, to be truthful the <unk> simply rage and <unk> <unk>
everybody loves to root for a <unk>
hit the earth like an <unk> i did nothing but shoot for the moon since
<unk>

<unk> get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a <unk> to bust the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of <unk>
me? i'm a product of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> hey doc, <unk> <unk> <unk> thank you, they got slim

inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
to meet <unk> and <unk> them into the motherfuckin' rock n'
roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i be <unk> in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you <unk> think it's all a game till i walk a <unk> of flames
off a <unk> and, tell me what in the fuck are you <unk>
little gay looking boy

so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
you <unk> a massacre
like you watching a church <unk> take place looking boy
<unk> <unk> that boy's <unk> that's all they say looking boy
you get a <unk> up, pat on the back
and a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
i get a <unk> <unk> from dre looking boy
i'mma work for everything i have
never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy
basically boy you're never gonna be <unk>
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back <unk> back nod
the way i'm racing around the track, call me <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the trailer park, the white trash god
<unk> before general <unk> this <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk>

so you be <unk> and i'll be <unk> you <unk> i'm <unk>
let off then i'm <unk> immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be <unk>
i'm the walking dead, but i'm just a talking head, a <unk> <unk>
but i got your mom deep <unk>

i'm out my <unk> <unk> we have nothing in common, <unk>
i'm a <unk> pinch yourself in the arm and pay <unk> <unk>
it's me, my <unk> <unk>
but it's <unk> <unk> if i don't <unk> what i do though

for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i <unk> and <unk>
enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few <unk> just in case 'cause even you <unk>
rappers are hungry looking at me like it's <unk>
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the <unk> but i still rap like i'm on my <unk> <unk> grind

so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you <unk>
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to <unk> you
like that one line i said on "i'm <unk> from the mathers lp
one where i tried to say i'd take seven kids from <unk>
put 'em all in a line, add an <unk> a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm

<unk> into an <unk> coming through the <unk>
you're stuck in a time <unk> from <unk> though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're <unk> as <unk> with fucking <unk>
you write <unk> fuck being normal
and i just bought a new <unk> from the future

to just come and shoot ya like when <unk> made ray j mad
'cause <unk> said he looked like a fag at pad
singin' to a man while he played piano
man, oh, man, that was the <unk> special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day
<unk> <unk> i'mma kill you"
lyrics coming at you at <unk> speed, <unk> <unk>

uh, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm <unk>
<unk> and i'm made of rubber
so that anything you say is <unk> off of me and it'll glue to you
i'm <unk> more than never <unk>
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's <unk>
never <unk> and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be <unk>
'cause i know the way to get 'em <unk>
i make <unk> music, you make elevator music
oh, he's too <unk>
well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
it's not <unk> it's pop, 'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock, shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it

i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it <unk> to you
while <unk> any one of these verses <unk> as you
<unk> <unk> hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to prove
that if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice <unk> too

school <unk> pill <unk>
but look at the <unk> these skills <unk> me
full of myself, but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million <unk> above you, ill when i speak in <unk>
but it's still tongue and <unk> fuck you
i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel, i'm asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy <unk> &amp; the boys, still <unk> but funky
but in my head there's something i can feel <unk> and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

they asking me to <unk> some of the women hate
but if you take into <unk> the bitter hatred that i had
then you may be a little patient and more <unk> to the situation
and understand the <unk>

but fuck it, life's <unk> you <unk> make <unk> then
but if i can't <unk> the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?
don't mistake it for satan
it's a <unk> mistake if you think i need to be <unk>
and take a vacation to trip a broad
and make her fall on her face and don't be a <unk>
be a <unk> think not
why be a king when you can be a <unk>shut it down lyrics

there's no limit on how far i would go, no <unk> no <unk>
why do we say that until we get that person that we <unk>

you want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
it's not a <unk> and i ain't on no <unk> for no mate

which is why i understand,
you can't be mad at a <unk> year old fan with a chip on his shoulder,
who only <unk> a half of a <unk>
and the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again,
only thing that makes him grin is to see me <unk>

papa needs to take his medication and sit the f**k down,
in his new chair that goes round and round,
that he bought from the money in his bank <unk>
that i get him every issue when the thing comes out,
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out,
and let his black side arm <unk> his white side,
yell <unk> loud enough that he might <unk>
he might find someone dumb enough who might <unk>

i'm just so fuckin' <unk> i just can't seem to get out this <unk>
if i could just get over this <unk> but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my <unk> took my lumps, fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get <unk> back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

i don't know how or why or when, i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm startin' to feel <unk> again, so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to <unk> but i just can't admit
or come to <unk> with the fact that i may be done with rap, i need a new <unk>

and i know some shit's so hard to swallow, but i just can't sit back and <unk>
in my own <unk> but i know one fact, i'll be one tough act to follow

in my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to

they can all get fucked, just stay true to you
so don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

i think i'm startin' to lose my sense of <unk> everything's so <unk> and <unk> i
almost feel like i gotta check the <unk> of the room, just as soon as i
walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so i try to <unk> any eye contact
'cause if i do that, then it opens the door for <unk> like i want that

i'm not lookin' for extra attention, i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest <unk>
i don't need no fuckin' man <unk> tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like <unk>

we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
now i could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' <unk>
or take this situation in which i'm placed in and get up and get my own

i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
or sat on the porch and <unk> and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

aunt <unk> always told me, <unk> makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that"
meanwhile i'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
till i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then 'cause i wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

but i already told you my whole life story, not just based on my <unk>
'cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably <unk> different
i guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least

in my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to

but off of the dome would probably be a little more
more <unk> for this type of song, whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of
sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta
so fuck it, i'mma start right here by just be <unk>

that you'd probably just <unk> up, yeah

i <unk> on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta
a stupid piece a paper, i'd rather let you see how
much i fuckin' hate you in a freestyle

what is life?
life is like a big <unk>
in front of your <unk> to slow you down
and every time you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground

what are friends?
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies with secret <unk>
and <unk> to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin

what is money?
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
<unk> make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down

tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not <unk> in a packed <unk>

and i was the man of the house, the <unk> so my shoulders carried the weight of the load

then nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
that's when i realized you were sick and it wasn't <unk> or <unk>
and to this day we <unk> <unk> and i hate it though, but

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on

'cause you ain't even get to witness your <unk> grow
but i'm sorry mama for <unk> out my <unk> at the time i was angry
<unk> maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause

now i know it's not your fault, and i'm not making jokes
