about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken, and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
well i don't wanna lose it either
i don't think i can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
so take my hand
well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
cause i know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall
but if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me

and i'm all you need and you never want more
then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
but you'd save the best for last
like i'm the one for you

i was born to <unk> those born to die .
i was <unk> to beat all odds like las vegas .

mmm... <unk> you...)
how i wish i could be with you...
(i miss you...)
how i wish, how i wish, how i wish i could be with you right now...

every morning, every <unk> every night, i wanna be with you;
it don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in a hotel room all day,
i just wanna be with you...
i love everything about you, from your <unk> <unk> shoes,
to the way you move when you're dancing with me...

do you remember our first <unk> it wasn't long enough...
remember the first time we spent those weeks <unk> they were not long enough...
all of our <unk> all of your sweet <unk> they're never long enough...sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad
it cuts through the deepest parts of me
and fills up my mouth with words that i cry
how i'm still trying to stay inside

hearts break and hearts wait
to make us grow from dust
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
so that we know that it hurts

our hearts break and hearts wait
to make us grow from dust
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
so that we know that it hurts

every now and then my memories <unk>
with the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
but as time goes on and my age gets older
i love the ones i know, they're enough to picture the rain

'cause heart break and hearts wait<div <unk> life is a movie
and watching
so get to the good part
and passed all the <unk>

sometimes hard to do the right thing
when the pressures is coming down like lightening
like they want me to be perfect
when they even know that hurting
'cause not easy
not made out of steel
forget that human, forget that real
act like you know me, but you never will
one thing i know for sure

show you
i'll show you

got to learn things
learn them the hard way
got to see what it feels like
no matter what they say

sometimes hard to do the right thing
when the pressures is coming down like lightening
like they want me to be perfect
when they even know that hurting
'cause not easy
not made out of steel
forget that human, forget that reali've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
always <unk> around in circles
but i must have <unk> into something
look at me
am i really alone with you?

i wake up feeling like my life's worth living
can't <unk> when i last felt that way
guess it must be all this love you're giving
never knew never knew
it could be like this

but i guess
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
some hearts have the stars on their side

some hearts
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes

some hearts just get lucky lucky sometimes
now <unk> have thought someone like you could love me?
you're the last thing my heart expected
<unk> have thought i'd ever find <unk>
someone who someone who
makes me feel like this

well i guess
some hearts

one foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
i knew that you were leaving this time
i thought about laying down in its path
thinking that you might get off for that

i remember that night we laid in bed
<unk> all our kids that we hadn't had yet
one for your grandma and one for mine
said we'd draw <unk> when it came time

i'll move on, baby, just like you
when the desert floods and the grass turns blue
when a sailing ship don't need her moon
it'll break my heart, but i'll get through
someday when i stop loving you

i bet all i had on a thing called love
i guess in the end it <unk> enough
and it's hard to watch you leave right now
i'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
somehow

i'll move on baby, just like you
when the desert floods and the grass turns blue
when a sailing ship don't need her moon[chorus:]

(you're gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

you had my heart inside of your hand
(you're gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

baby, i have no story to be told
but i've heard one on you and i'm gonna make your head burn

think of me in the depths of your despair
make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(you're gonna wish you never had met me)
the scars of your love remind me of us
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all

you'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sowi'm taking over my body
back in control, no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost
"t"s uncrossed and "i"s undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot
like flesh is all i got
not any more, flesh out the door, swat

i must've forgot, you can't trust me
i'm open a moment and close when you show it
before you know it i'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it
and the story unfolds
you should take my life
you should take my soul

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment
you know exactly where you're going
'cause the next moment, before you know it
time is slowing and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith



lean with it, rock with it
when we gunna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothing
we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet
to an introspective beat
it ain't the speakers that bump hearts
it's our hearts that make the beat

lean with it, rock with it
when we gunna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothingyou say you love me
well they feel like words to me
well this just ain't working
stop thinking you can run over me

i'm <unk> i'm settling
off to a foreign place
if i can't see what's in front of me

and i'm ready for change
go on, begone, bye bye, so long
can't you see that you're

fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
away, away, away, away
i opened up my eyes, and i finally realized
today, today, it's too late
you're fading away

got my mind made up, i ain't coming back again
no way, no way, no way, no way

silent night, holy night
all is calm, all is bright
round <unk> <unk> mother and child
holy infant so tender and <unk>
sleep in <unk> peace

silent night, holy nighti want to leave my footprints on the <unk> of time;
know there was something that meant something that i left behind...
when i leave this world, i'll leave no <unk>
leave something to remember, so they won't <unk>

i was here;
i lived, i loved - i was here...
i did... i've done everything that i wanted, and it was more than i thought it would be;
i will leave my mark so everyone will know - i was here....

i want to say i lived each day until i die,
and know that i meant something in somebody's life...
the hearts that i touched will be the proof that i leave
that i made a difference, and this world will see...

i was here;
i lived, i loved - i was here...
i did... i've done everything that i wanted, and it was more than i thought it would be;
i will leave my mark so everyone will know...

i was here;
i lived, i loved - i was here...
i did... i've done everything that i wanted, and it was more than i thought it would be;
i will leave my mark so everyone will know - i was here....

i just want them to know that i gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
left this world a little better, just because i was here...

i was here;i'm taking over my body
back in control, no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost
"t"s uncrossed and "i"s undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot
like flesh is all i got
not any more, flesh out the door, swat

i must've forgot, you can't trust me
i'm open a moment and close when you show it
before you know it i'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it
and the story unfolds
you should take my life
you should take my soul

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment
you know exactly where you're going
'cause the next moment, before you know it
time is slowing and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith



lean with it, rock with it
when we gunna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothing
we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet
to an introspective beat
it ain't the speakers that bump hearts
it's our hearts that make the beat

lean with it, rock with it
when we gunna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothinglast night
i was pouring out my heart like a <unk> to you
and with one kiss
i was a runaway train flying off the track to you

'cause you heard me right, and i won't try
to fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you

you know
people say a lot of things that they don't really mean
and last night
i told a little white lie hoping you'd forget the scene

where it felt like a movie under that porch light
couldn't help myself when you held me tight
said what i meant that i lied and said i was sorry

i unapologize
i meant every word
won't take back the way i feel about you
i can't unsay what you heard

remember <unk> we said our love would last forever

there come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
a sunny day will suddenly turn cold
time will teach you all you need to learn

you get excitement in your bones
and everything you do's a game
when night comes and you're on your own
you can say i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

who wants to be riding high
when you'll just crumble back on down
you give up everything you are
and even then you don't get far
they make believe that everything
is exactly what it seems
but at least when you're at your worst
you know how to feel things

see when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

go ahead and steal my heart
to make me cry again
'cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
when we were both right
and no one had blame
but now i give up
on this endless game

'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my bonesnight falls with gravity
the earth turns from sanity
taking my only friend i know
he leaves a <unk> his name is hope

i'm never what i like
i'm double-sided
and i just can't hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
'cause i'm twisted up
i'm twisted up inside

the <unk> of the night melt away
under the warm glow of survival of the day
then we move on
my shadow grows taller along with my fears
and my frame <unk> <unk> as night grows near

when the sun is coming, window <unk>
and the silver lining rides the hills
i will be saved for one whole day
until the sun make the hills its grave

i'm never what i like
i'm double-sided
and i just can't hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
'cause i'm twisted up
i'm twisted up inside

i'm never what i like

and what you've been out there searching for forever
is in your hands
and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else
seem so small

it's so easy to get lost inside

is it real or is it fantasy?
forever or just <unk>

and i'm terrified but i'm not leaving
i know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)

say a prayer to yourself
he says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
and then i get, a scary thought
that he's here, means he's never lost

you can see it through my chest
said i'm terrified but i'm not leaving

i didn't give to you on purpose

nose to nose
palm to palm
we were always just that close

wrist to wrist
toe to toe
lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it feels like more than distance between us

in this california king bed
we're ten thousand miles apart
i'll be california wishing on these stars
warmed your heart for me
my california king

eye to eye
cheek to cheek
side by side
you were sleeping next to me

arm in arm
<unk> to dawn
with the curtains drawn
and a little last night on these sheets
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it feels like more than distance between us

in this california king bed
we're ten thousand miles apart
i'll be california wishing on these stars
warmed your heart for me
my california king

just when i felt like giving up on us
you turned around and gave me one last touch
that made everything feel better(i want you, i want you, i want you, i want you)
(let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself)

lookin' in your eyes
makes me wonder how
i got so much time
with you and there's more around
i know all the competition after to you
so i get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

that we're living
in a fairytale, no malice and no lies
baby oh, it's hard to believe
that the love you have inside you is only mine

that's how i know
i can't be your only one
no i, can't be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i can't
i can't be your only one
no i, can't be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget it, yeah

as i'm laying down, with you every night
it still gets to me that you remain by my side
i ain't saying that i'm not deserving of you
but i was dreaming bigger than i ever knew when

i wished for living
in a fairytale, no malice and no lies

thought that i'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'cause you give me chills every time we chill;
i spend all of my days doin', doin'...

it's better when something is wrong
you get excitement in your bones
and everything you do's a game
when night comes and you're on your own
you can say i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

who wants to be riding high
when you'll just crumble back on down
you give up everything you are
and even then you don't get far
they make believe that everything
is exactly what it seems
but at least when you're at your worst
you know how to feel things

see when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

go ahead and steal my heart
to make me cry again
'cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
when we were both right
and no one had blame
but now i give up
on this endless game

'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my boneskiss the moon goodbye
but don't close your eyes, your eyes
it's the end of the night
but the beginning of time, for you and i
i can't believe that my body is still moving
it makes me feel like we're doing something right.

baby when the night starts slipping
when the night starts slipping
when the night starts slipping away

ask us where you at, we don't know
and don't care (don't care)
all we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
you got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
now she in the club with a freaky dress on
cats don't want her to keep that dress on
tryna get enough drinks in her system
take her to the telly and make her a victim

on the brain
ball player in her face
they shake the spot
she's just another cake

easy for a good girl to go bad
and once we gone
best believe we gone forever
don't be the reason
you better learn how to treat us right
'cause once a good girl goes bad
we die forever

he steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah

won't care <unk> <unk> all you do is keep me at home
won't let me go nowhere
he thinks because i'm at home
i won't be gettin' it on
and now i'm finding numbers
in the jacket pockets
chicks calling the house <unk>
it's getting out of control
finally i can't take no more
he <unk> a letter on the stairs
saying this is the end
i packed my bag and left with your best friend

easy for a good girl to go bad
and once we gone
best believe we gone forever
don't be the reason
you better learn how to treat us righti'm fairly local, i've been around
i've seen the streets you're walking down
i'm fairly local, good people now
oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

i'm evil to the core
what i shouldn't do, i will
they say i'm emotional
what i want to save, i'll kill
is that who i truly am?
i truly don't have a chance
tomorrow i'll keep a beat
and repeat yesterday's dance

yo, this song will never be on the radio
even if my clique were to pick and the people were to <unk>
it's the few, the proud, and the emotional
yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral
the world around us is burning but we're so cold
it's the few, the proud, and the emotional

i'm fairly local, i've been around
i've seen the streets you're walking down
i'm fairly local, good people now
oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

i'm not evil to the core
what i shouldn't do, i will fight
i know i'm emotional
what i want to save, i will try
i know who i truly am
i truly do have a chance
tomorrow i'll switch the beat
to avoid yesterday's dance

yo, this song will never be on the radio
even if my clique were to pick and the people were to <unk>
it's the few, the proud, and the emotionali was sitting on my doorstep
hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
but i knew i had to do it
and he wouldn't understand

so hard to see myself without him
i felt a piece of my heart break
but when you're standing at a crossroad
there's a choice you gotta make

chorus:
i guess it's gonna have to hurt
i guess i'm gonna have to cry
and let go of some things i've loved
to get on to the other side
i guess it's gonna break me down
like falling when you're trying to fly
it's <unk> but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
starts with goodbye

i know there's a blue horizondidn't i give it all, tried my best?
gave you everything i had, everything and no less
didn't i do it right? did i let you down?
maybe you got too used to having me around
still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
it's gonna be an empty road without me right here

but go on and take it, take it all with you
don't look back at this crumbling fool
just take it all with my love
take it all with my love

maybe i should leave to help you see
nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
so is it over? is this really it?
you're giving up so easily, i thought you loved me more than this

but go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
don't look back at this crumbling fool
just take it all with my love
take it all with my love
everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
it's so hard to break in
there's no way to fake it
everybody tells me that it's wrong what i'm feelin'
and i shouldn't believe in
the dreams that i'm dreamin'

i hear it every day
i hear it all the time
i'm never gonna amount too much
but they're never gonna change my mind, no

tell me, tell me, tell me
something i don't know, something i don't know
something i don't know
tell me, tell me, tell me
something i don't know, something i don't know
something i don't know

like how many inches in a mile
what it takes to make you smile
get you not to treat me like a child, baby

tell me, tell me, tell me
something i don't know, something i don't know
something i don't know

tell me, tell me something i don't know

everybody tells me i don't know what i'm doing
the life i'm <unk>
the odds i'll be losing
everybody tells me that it's one in a million, no
one in a billion, oh

i hear it every day
i hear it all the time
i'm never gonna amount too much
but they're never gonna change my mind, no

tell me, tell me, tell me
something i don't know, something i don't know
something i don't know

selena hit the track
like <unk> makin' waves
like cold <unk> make 'em say
"i'm <unk>
are you ready for it? (yeah, i'm ready for it)
really ready for it? (yeah, i'm ready for it)i wanna fall inside your ghost
and fill up every hole inside my mind
and i want everyone to know
that i am half a soul
divided

sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
either way you're by my side until my dying days
and if i'm not there and i'm far away
i said, "don't be afraid."
we're going home.

i wanna strip myself of breath
a breathless beast of death i've made for you
a <unk> writing piece of song
will help me carry on
but these you heard

sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
either way you're by my side until my dying days
and if i'm not there and i'm far away
i said, "don't be afraid."
we're going home.

so the <unk> ran out of gas
a passenger purse and grabbed a map
and the driver inside it <unk> a new route to save the past
and checked his watch and grabbed a cab
a beautifully planned taxi cab
a <unk> had it cleared out back
and two men started to <unk>

driving once again
but now this time there were three men
and then i heard one of them say
"i know the night will turn to gray
i know the stars will start to fade
when all the darkness fades away
we had to steal him from his <unk>
so he could see another day

where worlds collide and days are dark
you may have my number
you can take my name
but you'll never have my heart

let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together

when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all together

but nine times outta ten, i know you're trying
so i'm trying to be fair
and you're trying to be there and to care
and you're caught up in your permanent emotions
all the loving i've been giving goes unnoticed
it's just floating in the air, lookie there
are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
if i wasn't me, would you still feel me?
like on my worst day? or am i not <unk> enough?
i don't care about the lights or the beams
spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
only way to go is up, skin <unk> too tough

'cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
you, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
you, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
you, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

nine times out of ten, i'm in my feelings
but ten times out of <unk> i'm only human

if i ain't got something, i don't give a damn, 'cause i got it with you
i don't know much about <unk> but i know 1 + 1 <unk> 2,
and it's me and you

dragging your heels, just tell me how it feels
in your nine to five kind of life, pretty from the outside

when did i become the <unk>
why do i deserve this <unk>
when i'm fighting hard to get back to you
i'm confused by what your silence means
when you've built your home in <unk> waters
when did i become the <unk>when i first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
you had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
i only wanted to kick it, so i said 'cool, you can keep her'
long as you satisfy me
but as the weeks went by i, i started feelin' strange
somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' i can't explain
i think i'm fallin' in love with you boy
i'm needing you so much, i'm cryin' just to feel your touch
i gotta leave you

i didn't want no man
i didn't wanna fall in love, and
i didn't care about your girl
i didn't care how we would end up

but that was then, this is now
i think i'm <unk> love
i don't wanna wreck up your home
that's why i'm <unk> i gotta go

when i first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
you had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
i only wanted to kick it, so i said 'cool, you can keep her'

somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' i can't explain
i think i'm fallin' in love with you boy
i'm needing you so much, i'm cryin' just to feel your touch
i gotta leave you

baby boy, let's conceive an angel<div class="lyricbox">i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire
exhale desire
i know it's dire
my time today

i have these thoughts
so often i ought
to replace that slot
with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

sometimes quiet is violent
i find it hard to hide it
my pride is no longer inside

it's on my sleeve
my skin will scream
<unk> me
of who i killed
inside my dream
i hate this car
that i'm driving
there's no hiding for me

i'm forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the <unk> wheel

i have these thoughts
so often i ought
to replace that slot
with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

i ponder of something <unk>
'cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear
oh dear, i don't know if we know why we're here
oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound

there are things we can do
but from the things that work, there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

and there's faith and there's sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake
and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think
a shadow tilts its head at me
spirits in the dark are waiting
i won't let the wind go quietly

be the one, be the one
to take my soul and make it undone
to take me home and show me the sun
i know, i know
you can bring the fire, i can bring the bones
you make the fire and my bones will make it grow

where we're from, there's no sun
our hometown's in the dark
where we're from, we're no one

a shadow tilts its head at me
spirits in the dark are waiting
i won't let the wind go quietly

put away, put away
all the <unk> your father served today
your <unk> believe me when i say
we don't know, we don't know
how to put back the power in our soul
where to find what once was in our bonesi know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
we belong

lately, you make me feel all i am is a <unk> plan
i'll say i'm done and then you smile at me and i'll forget
everything i <unk>

i buy into those eyes and into your lies
chorus
you say you'll call, but i know you
you say you're coming home, but i know you
you say you'll call, but i know you won't.

i wish you were where you're supposed to be
close to me
but here i am just staring at this candle burning out
still no sound

of footsteps on my stairs

that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
now we don't wanna fall but
we're trippin' in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam &amp; eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny &amp; cher

i trusted him, but when i followed you
i saw you together
(i didn't know about you then 'till i saw you with him again)

we'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone[intro: rick ross]
all we wanted was opportunity
(just <unk> lord <unk>

[verse 1: drake]
it's your worst <unk> it's my first night here
and this girl right here, who knows what she <unk>
so i'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there, i don't trust these hoes at all
but that's just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple <unk> stars that i'm ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna my only role models
<unk> and jordan my only role models
that's why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
bottom <unk> and <unk> and some bracelets and <unk>
all of the little <unk> that make me a king
i never hear the <unk> they try and point out to me
but it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
i'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about christmas in <unk>
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some <unk> a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs. <unk> they're making the cookie stretch
i know it so well, i know the hustle so well
stunt like i'm working <unk> right by the <unk>
drug money <unk> record clean
spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
<unk> <unk> for real, <unk> <unk> for real
places they say they've been, we've actually going for real
i'm really killin' shit, fuck all the <unk> rapping
i'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
mixtape legend, underground <unk>
lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
with my new bitch that's living in palm <unk>
young ass nigga, <unk> dreams
they take the <unk> from the past and compare us
i wonder if they'd ever survive in this <unk>
in a time where it's <unk>
to pull all your <unk> out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be <unk> fun at
never the flow though, they know i run that
fuck you all, i claim that whenever
i change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
<unk> i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne at forever
i'm a <unk> of either marley or hendrix
i haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
i'm hearing all of the <unk> i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin' emotion don't ever mean i'm a pussy
know that i don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows, lord knows, i'm heavy, i got my weight up
<unk> boost your <unk> up, it's time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me, then who should i be afraid of?
bought a white ghost, now shit is gettin' <unk>
<unk> very <unk> like shit you see in the movies
in this bitch all drinks on the house like <unk>baby you're a <unk> ball
crashing into me
nothing i can do but fall
piece by piece
you broke down every part of me
that ever thought i'd never need you, baby

it's twisted, messed up
and the more i think about it
it's crazy, but so what
i may never understand it
i'm caught up and i'm hanging on
i'm gonna love you even if it's wrong

everybody's telling me
i'm over my head
if they don't feel you loving me
they all say that i've gone crazy
<unk> but it's too late now to save
i'm too tangled

it's twisted, messed up
and the more i think about it
it's crazy, but so what
i may never understand it
i'm caught up and i'm hanging on
i'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
even if it's twisted

maybe it's not right
but that's all right
yeah, it's all right tonight
found myself today singing out your name
you said i'm crazy
if i am i'm crazy for you

sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
turns me crazy
but it's you who makes me lose my head

and every time i'm meant to be acting sensible
you drift into my head
and turn me into a crumbling fool

tell me to run and i'll race
if you want me to stop i'll freeze
and if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby
and make me crazy for you

i like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
started realizing a couple places i can take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money, <unk> vacation
and <unk> a generation that's lacking in patience
i've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
we've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
well, fuck it, we had a couple <unk>
we might have rolled a white <unk> just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should <unk> it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child, beautiful child, i'm in your zone
looking like you came from the <unk> on your own
my mother is <unk> and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and <unk>
y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something i'm missing and disappear when i'm bored
but girl, what <unk> was i looking for before?
who you settling for? who better for you than the boy, <unk>

cause i love me, i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me, i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?
darling you, you give but you cannot take love

thinkin' about texas back when porsche used to work at <unk>
or further back then that, before i had the houston <unk>
when i got summer a michael <unk> with my <unk> debit
a weak attempt at <unk> i'll never forget it

my pride is no longer inside

it's on my sleeve
my skin will scream
<unk> me
of who i killed
inside my dream
i hate this car
that i'm driving
there's no hiding for me

i'm forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the <unk> wheel

i have these thoughts
so often i ought
to replace that slot
with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

i ponder of something <unk>
'cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear
oh dear, i don't know if we know why we're here
oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound

there are things we can do
but from the things that work, there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

and there's faith and there's sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake
and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think
she was drivin' last friday on her way to <unk>
on a <unk> christmas eve
goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
with the baby in the backseat
fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
on faith and gasoline
it'd been a long, hard year

she had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
she was goin' way too fast
before she knew it she was <unk>
on a thin black <unk> of glass
she saw both their lives flash before her eyes
she didn't even have time to cry
she was so scared
she threw her hands up in the air

jesus, take the wheel
take it from my hands
'cause i can't do this on my own
i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
just save me from this road i'm on
jesus, take the wheel

it was still gettin' colder
when she made it to the shoulder
and the car came to a stop
she cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
sleepin' like a rock
but for the first time in a long time
she <unk> her head to pray
she said, "i'm sorry for the way
i've been livin' my life
i know i've got to changethings have been so crazy and <unk>
i should have gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
it's probably better <unk>

so if you gotta go
if there's anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if you're looking for a purpose

you put the <unk> in the <unk> and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was <unk>

now i'm all singing karaoke
further than i've ever been
so if you gotta go
if there's any way i can help

isn't it ironic that the girl i wanna marry is a wedding planner
that tells 'em my life is too much and moves to atlanta
damn, of all the places you could go
i just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

i always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
i hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
i would be my life like i bet my heart
that you were the one, baby
i've never been so sure of anything before
you're driving my heart crazy

i can't hold out
i can't hold back now
like i've done before

darling, look at me
i've fallen like a fool for you
darling, can't you see
i'd do anything you want me to

i tell myself i'm in too deep
then i fall a little farther
every time you look at me

how do you do that, babe?
make me feel like i'm the only girl alive for you
i don't know what it is that makes me fall like this
first time in your arms i knew

the way you held melast night i got served a little bit too much
of that <unk> baby
last night i did things i'm not proud of
and i got a little crazy
last night i met a guy on the dance floor
and i let him call me baby

and i don't even know his last name
my mama would be so ashamed
it started off, "hey cutie, where you from?"
and then it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know his last name

we left the club right around 3 o'clock
in the morning
his <unk> sitting there, in the parking lot
when it should have been a warning
i had no clue what i was getting into
so, i'll blame it on the cuervo
oh, where did my manners go?

and i don't even know his last name
my mama would be so ashamed
it started off, "hey cutie, where you from?"
and then it turned into, "oh no, what have i done?"
and i don't even know his last name
here we go!

today, i woke up
thinking about elvis somewhere in vegas
i'm not sure how i got here
or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
outta nowhere
i gotta go
take the chips and the <unk> and hit the road
they say what happens here, stays here
all of this will disappear
there's just one little <unk>
(eh, eh, eh, eh)
no no no no no no (eh, eh, eh, eh)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (eh, eh, eh, eh)

a <unk> hides behind a mask of my disguise
and who i am today is worse than other times
you don't know what i've done, i'm wanted and on the run
i'm wanted and on the run
so i'm taking this moment to live in the future

release me from the present
i'm obsessin' all these questions
why i'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
these lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

(eh, eh, eh, eh)
no no no no no no (eh, eh, eh, eh)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (eh, eh, eh, eh)

you don't know my brain the way you know my name
you don't know my heart the way you know my face
you don't know what i've done, i'm wanted and on the run
i'm wanted and on the run
so i'm taking this moment to live in the future

release me from the present
i'm obsessin' all these questions
why i'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
these lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

my people singing

hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
people, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
they rip it, flip it, but these are just <unk>
wrote this in three <unk> three words to a line
it's just <unk> <unk> i'm the kind of guy
who takes every moment he knows he <unk> in
music to use it, for others to use it
you're dead, 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
<div <unk> black cadillacs driving in a slow <unk>
headlights shining bright in the middle of the day,
one is for his <unk>
the other for the woman who loved him at night,
two black cadillacs <unk> for the first time.

and his brother said he was a good friend,
but the women in the two black veils bother to cry,

you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment
you know exactly where you're going
'cause the next moment, before you know it
time is slowing and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith



lean with it, rock with it
when we gunna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothing
we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet
to an introspective beat
it ain't the speakers that bump hearts
it's our hearts that make the beat

lean with it, rock with it
when we gunna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothingsuppose i called you up tonight and told you that i love you
and suppose i said i want to come back home
and suppose i cried and said i think i finally learned my lesson
and i'm tired of spending all my time alone

if i told you that i realized you're all i ever wanted
and it's killing me to be so far away
would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
or would you simply laugh at me and say

i told you so, oh, i told you so
i told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
i told you so, but you had to go
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

if i got down on my knees and told you i was yours forever
would you get down on yours too and take my hand
would we get that old time feeling, would we laugh and talk for hours
the way we did when our love first began
money, cars, clothes,
the hoes, i suppose

you think i'm playing

when you know it's the truth
nobody else can do it quite like i do
all my kisses

some white trash version of <unk> karaoke
right now she's probably saying, "i'm <unk>

that lipstick on your <unk>
well it ain't my shade of pink
and i can tell by the smell of that <unk>
it's like forty dollars too cheap
and there's a little wine stain
on the pocket of your white cotton thread
well you drink beer and <unk> boy
and you know i don't drink red

<unk> up on the bedroom floor
you should've hid it in the closet
you should've burned it, you should've lost it

clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
leave 'em blowing in the wind and say goodbye to you
all those midnights sneaking in, "i'm late again, oh i'm so sorry"
all the ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

if the <unk> get to asking
i won't cover nothing up

standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
one tear hit the hard wood, it fell like broken glass
she said sometimes love <unk> away
and you just can't get it back let's face it

for one split second she almost turned around
but that would be like pouring raindrops back into a cloud
so she took another step and said
i see the way out and i'm gonna take it

i don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by wasted

another glass of <unk> but it still don't kill the pain
he <unk> to the sink and pours it down the drain
he said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
gotta face it

'cause i don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by wasted
oh, i don't wanna keep on <unk> missing
the still of the morning, the color of the night

what's a life with no <unk> please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know

they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
'cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

so you cry still, tears all in the <unk>
big girls all get a little taste (aww)
pushing me away so i give her space (aww)
dealing with a heart that i didn't break

i'll be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know
trying to run from that, say you done with that
on your face, girl it just don't show

when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the <unk> over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go <unk>

you won't ever have to worry
you won't ever have to hide
and you've seen all my mistakes
so look me in my eyes

[rihanna]
'cause if you let me, here's what i'll do:
i'll take care of you...
i've loved and i've lost

[drake]
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you, but i'll lie if i have to
'cause you don't say you love me
to your friends, when they ask you
even though we both know that you do
you do

one time, been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
'cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes[drake]
i forgot about you last night

instead these girls taking it <unk>
now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore

wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
so they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
to the point that drake compare me to <unk> <unk>
but once they have my pants and my <unk>

<unk> me, pleasing me, easily boy, i'm addicted to you
got a have ya for all the things that u do
it something bout this feeling, it's crazy,
amazing that stays with me all night and day,
makes my temperature rise
boy your love has got me so hypnotized

i'm feeling something that i can't understand
it's like i'm captured by the touch of your hand
its so vibe it's your style it the way the that u smile
get a little rush when i hear your name
it's all magnetic with your hand next to me
holdin' me close happens so naturally
we connect, its electric, this felling inside
didn't know that even if i tried ??

(chorus:)
you got me spinning like a merry go round
feels like i'm flyin' but i ain't off the ground
fallin' fast i'm a afraid can't escape there's no waythey say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway, highway
but will they be alive tomorrow?

they think this thing is a highway, if it was our way
we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
i wasn't raised in the hood
but i know a thing or two about pain and darkness
if it wasn't for this music, i don't know how i would have fought this
<unk> all these songs i'm hearing are so heartless
don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
i'm in <unk> <unk> with what i want and what is poppin'
in the <unk> it seems to me that <unk> on the radio are currency
my <unk> only free when i'm playing shows

they say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway, highway
but will they be alive tomorrow?

(they be alive <unk>
i'm sorry if that question i asked last
scared you a bit like a <unk> in a gas mask
if you ask <unk> he's my brother, he likes when i rap fast
but let's <unk> back to this
who would you live and die for on that <unk>
but the problem is, there's another list that <unk>
and no one really wants to think about this
forget <unk> forget <unk>
forget <unk> my <unk>
if you get in between someone i love and me
you're gonna feel the heat of my <unk>

all these songs i'm hearing are so heartless
don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

they say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
but we go where we want to<div class="lyricbox">[intro]

[drake - verse
should i spend the weekend in vegas
living inside the moment
not taking pictures to save
i mean how could i
my memories never faded

i can't relate to these
my enemies never made it
am... still here with who i started
the game needed life, i put my heart in it
blew myself up, i'm on some martyr
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship

i'm 23 with a money
growing more too, i just <unk> 100 <unk>
ironic 'cause my mother was a florist and that's how she met my pops now my garden is enormous

it's happening penny lane, just like you said
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead, ahh
that's word to the millions that they putting up
trying to do better than good


what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
the people i don't have the time to hang with
look at me and say the same shit
(they say)
you promised me you would never change huh huh huh oh
you promised me you would never oh, huh huh huh huh, oh

[drake - verse 2]
am i wrong for making light of my situation
on, when 40 got some shit for me to snap
now that i'm on i don't want to really worry about getting back on
just trying to stay on

and i'll be acting like i don't know how to work a

just make it snow in california
i'll even settle for rain
don't want him to go tomorrow morning
give me something to make him stay
wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
will be the perfect gift
let it snow let it snow let it snow
let it snow
in calif-orn-i-a

dear santa
what happened to the plan we had
i checked the news and it said
it'd be a sunny day
make it go away
see i i really need him to stay
for a couple more days
can't you make his
five o'clock flight delay
won't you find a way

i don't need another gift

but, i guess that's just the motion
and their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
that's the motion (ooh)
i guess that's just the motion (oooh)

yeah,
looking back on it at least my pride is in <unk>
'cause we said no strings attached
and i still got tied up in that
every thing that i write is either for her or about her
so i'm with her even when i'm here without her
and she know it
the girl that i want to save is like a danger to my health
try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
i always thought she was perfect when she was being herselfif you're not the one for me
then how come i can bring you to your <unk>
why do i hate the idea of being free?
and if i'm not the one for you
you've gotta stop holding me the way you do
oh honey if i'm not the one for you
why have we been through what we have been <unk>

it's so cold out here
in your <unk>
i want you to be my keeper
but not if you are so reckless

if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge
if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
don't pretend that you don't want me
our love ain't water under the bridge

say that our love ain't water under the bridge

nicki minaj:
in time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
world tour, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big signnow is the climax to the story
that gives the demons and angels purpose
they fly around while we are walking
and mold our emotions just to please them

i am cold, can you hear
i will fly, with no hope, no fear
and the ground, taunts my wings
plummet as i sing, plummet as i sing

all we are is an <unk> of <unk> birds
we find our worth in giving birth and stuff
we're lining our homes against <unk> <unk>
and we think the going is tough
we pick songs to sing, remind us of things that no body cares about
and honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now
if you decide to live by, what you <unk> wrong and what's right
believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
your <unk> will creep in your head and you'll cry
but if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
we can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free

i am cold, can you hear
i will fly, with no hope, no fear
and the ground, taunts my wings
plummet as i sing, plummet as i

i am cold, can you hearyou're set in stone and i never give in
i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
you say i'm selfish, i agree with you on that
i think you're giving off way too much in fact
i say we've only known each other one year
you say, "pff, i've known you longer my dear"

you like to be so close, i like to be alone
i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
but we do, but we do, but we do

i thought i knew myself, somehow you know me more
i've never known this inevitable
you're the first to make out whenever we are two
i don't know who i'd be if i didn't know you
you're so <unk> i'm so conservative
you're so adventurous, i'm so very cautious, combined
you think we would and we do, but we do, but we do, but we do

favouritism ain't my thing but
in this situation i'll be glad

favouritism ain't my thing but

to understand how you think your world is ending
sending <unk> and red flags in waves

i'll pray that one day you see
the only difference between life and dying
is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
so try to love me and i'll try to save you

won't you stay alive?
i'll take you on a ride
i will make you believe you are lovely

won't you stay alive?

could there be a possibility
i'm trying to say what's up
cause i'm made for you, and you for me
baby now is time for us
shall i give it all together
but enough is enough
they say we're too young for love
but i'm catching feelings, catching feelings

in my head we're already together
i'm cool alone, but with you i'm better
i just wanna see you smile
you say the word and i'll be right there
i ain't never going nowhere

i'm just trying to see where this can take us
cause everything about you girl is so <unk>
i think i finally got it done
now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror
and say it to her

could there be a possibility
i'm trying to say what's up
cause i'm made for you, and you for me
baby now is time for us
shall i give it all together
but enough is enough
they say we're too young for love
but i'm catching feelings, catching feelingsnever woulda <unk> to birmingham if it hadn't been for love

never woulda seen the trouble that i'm in if it hadn't been for love
woulda been gone like a <unk> wind if it hadn't been for love
nobody knows it better than me: i wouldn't be wishin' i was free

four cold walls against my will
at least i know he's lyin' still
four cold walls without <unk>
lord have mercy on my soul

never woulda gone to that side of town if it hadn't been for love

'cause you're keeping me safe and warm
even when i'm home alone
wearing nothing but your cologne

maybe you should call off the day
give your girl some time to play
running my mind 'cause my heart lost all control
only one thing that can give me that <unk>

someone he could take fishing
throw the football and be his pride and joy

he could already see him holding that <unk>
taking his team to state

all those big dreams changed

and now he's wrapped around her finger
she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little
beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-american girl

sixteen short years later
she was falling for the <unk> football star
before you knew it he was dropping <unk>
skipping practice just to spend more time with her

and it's reckless and clumsy
'cause i know you can't love me here

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like adam &amp; eve
tragedy was our destiny
like sonny &amp; cher
i don't care

fightin' every inch of our fibers
'cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
we are both too foolish to stop

now you don't wanna let go
and i don't wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two
who knew?
and we don't wanna fall but
we're tripping in our hearts
and it's reckless and clumsy
and i know you can't love me herei lay alone awake at night
sorrow fills my eyes
but i'm not strong enough to cry
despite of my disguise
i'm left with no shoulder
but everybody wants to lean on me
i guess i'm their soldier
well, who's gonna be mine

who's there to save the hero
when she's left all alone
and she's crying out for help
who's there to save the hero
who's there to save the girl
after she saves the world

i bottle all my hurt inside
i guess i'm living a lie
inside my mind each day i die
what can bring me back to life?
a simple word, a <unk>
someone to say you're beautiful
come find this buried treasure
rainbows lead to a pot of gold

who's there to save the hero
when she's left all alone
and she's crying out for help
who's there to save the hero
who's there to save the girl
after she saves the world

i'm way too good to you
you take my love for granted
i just don't understand it

we gotta take time with this
cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
let me see if this is something i can fix
you got somebody other than me
don't play the victim when you're with me
free time is <unk> me more than it seems
<unk> things[drake]
yeah, look...
me and <unk> we from two different walks of life
usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to <unk>
the watch is <unk> <unk> sum awkward ice
i never <unk> for a <unk> but been <unk> twice
i'm awful nice, lyrics that i often write
<unk> no talent rappers to get off the mic
and i could pick you up from work when you get off the night
drop you at the house soon as you get off the <unk> man
i flow so cool like <unk> nights
when i body this, tell me if the <unk> light

it's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
imagine if these other niggas <unk> and his blows

they'll be <unk> sub a nigga in like <unk>
she was lost in so many different ways
out in the darkness with no guide
i know the cost of a losing hand
there but for the grace of god go i

i found heaven on earth
you were my last, my first
and then i hear this voice inside
ave maria

i've been alone
when i'm surrounded by friends
how could the silence be so loud
but i still go home knowing that i've got you
there's only us when the lights go down

you are my heaven on earth
you are my <unk> my <unk>
i always hear this voice inside
singing ave maria
rihanna:
on the first page of our story, the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil, i don't know why i'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked <unk> and you take that to new <unk>
but you'll always be my <unk> even though you've lost your mind

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, oh-oh, i love the way you lie

now there's <unk> in our <unk> glass is shattered from the fight
in this <unk> of war you'll always win, even when i'm right
'cause you feed me <unk> from your hand, with violent words and empty <unk>
and it's sick that all these <unk> are what keeps me satisfied

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie

i love the way you lie, oh-oh, i love the way you lie, oh-oh
so maybe i'm a <unk>
i try to run but i don't wanna ever leave
till the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories

<unk>
it's morning, you wake a sun ray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of <unk>
hush baby speak softly, tell me you're <unk> sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so i can push you off me

try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby without you i'm nothing, i'm so lost hug me
then tell me how ugly i am, but that you'll always love me

then after that shove me, in the <unk> of the
<unk> path that we're on, two <unk> but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's <unk> 'cause we're that luckyi can see it in your <unk> you're angry
regret got shit on what you're feeling now
mad cause he ain't like me
oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
all the care i would take, all the love that we made
now you're trying to find somebody to replace what i gave to you
it's a shame you didn't keep it: <unk> <unk>
i know that you gon hear <unk> i'm the man
yeah i said it! bitch i'm the man
don't you forget it
the way you walk, that's me
the way you talk, that's me
the way you've got your hair <unk> did you forget that's me?
and the voice in your <unk> right <unk> that's me
and the voice in your <unk> that's me

i'm quiet with it; i just ride with it
moment i stop havin' fun with it, i'll be done with it
i'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
and like a <unk> you need to come with it
don't run from it, like h-town in the summer time, i keep it 100
met a lot of girls in my times there, word to paul wall, not one <unk>
i was <unk> there in my first year, man i know that place like i come from it
backstage at <unk> in '09 like "is bun <unk>
fuck that, is anyone comin' before i show up there and there's no one <unk>

what kids are doing, are killing themselves
they feel they have no control of their <unk> cell
and if you're one of them, then you're one of me
and you would do almost anything just to feel free

yeah, am i right? of course i am
convince me <unk> would take all night
before you walk away, there's one more thing i want to say
our <unk> are sick but that's okay

fake you out
i'll fake you out

smoking weed under star <unk>
i guess we'll never know what <unk> gets us
but seeing my family have it all
took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

and really i think i like who i'm becoming
there's times where i might do it just to do it like it's nothing
there's times when i might blow like <unk> on a vacation
for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

i got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me<div class="lyricbox">i remember when you use to take me on a
bike ride everyday on the <unk> (you remember that? we were <unk>
and i remember when you could do no wrong
you'd come home from work and i <unk> in your arms when i saw you
i was so happy to see you (i was so <unk> so happy to see you)

because you loved me i overcome
and i'm so proud of what you've become
you've given me such security
no matter what mistakes i make you're there for me
you kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
you understood my fears and you protected me
treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why

i want my <unk> son to be like my daddy
i want my husband to be like my daddy
there is no one else like my daddy
and i thank you for loving me

i still remember the <unk> on your face
when you found out i'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(my first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
i still remember i caught you crying 'cause of my tattoo
could have said i told you <unk>
instead you said you'd get one too
<unk> my mama said y'all get one just like <unk>

words can't express my <unk> <unk> for you
i appreciate what you do
you've given me such security
no matter what mistakes i make you're there for me
you kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
you understand my fears and you protected me
treasure every <unk> memory and that's why

i want my <unk> son to be like my daddy
i want my husband to be like my daddy
there is no one else like my daddyall the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out.

[verse 1]
i can't believe i believed everything we had would last
so young and naive of me to think she was from your past
silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

i can't believe i fell for your <unk> i'm smarter than that
so dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
it took me some time but now i moved on
because i realized i got

[chorus]
me, myself and i that's all i got in the end
that's what i found out
and there ain't no need to cry
i took a vow that from now on
i will be my own best friend

[repeat chorus]
so controlling to say that you love me but you don't
your family told me one day i would see it on my own
next thing i know i'm dealing with your three kids in my home
love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
took me some time but now i am strong
because i realized i got

[chorus]
[repeat chorus]
[bridge]

but now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

he pretends he's okay but should see

and i know you know better than to call me
let's just hide out under the covers
one more secret between two old lovers
what can it hurt?

i ain't hung up on you
i ain't in love with you
this is just time that i'm wasting
one or two little sips
i'm alright, i can quit
you're just someone that i'm tasting

i don't have to have you
i don't need to need you
just a high that i'm chasing
don't think i'm coming back
it's just a relapse

i know i said, i said it was over
but it's hard when i miss you to stay sober
so if i show up here at your door again
oh, it's just me falling off of the <unk>
what can it hurt?

i ain't hung up on you
i ain't in love with you
this is just time that i'm wasting
one or two little sips
i'm alright, i can quit
you're just someone that i'm tasting

i don't have to have you
i don't need to need you
just a high that i'm chasing
don't think i'm coming back
it's just a relapsei've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
if i'm wrong i am right, don't need to look no further
this ain't lust, i know this is love

but if i tell the world, i'll never say enough
'cause it was not said to you
and that's exactly what i need to do if i end up with you

should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?
or would it be a waste even if i knew my place
should i leave it there?
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?

i build myself up and fly around in circles
waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be it?

or should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?
or would it be a waste even if i knew my place
should i leave it there?
should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere?

should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavementswake up to your dreams
and watch them come true

my heart
i only wanted to have fun
learning to fly, learning to run
i let my heart decide the way
when i was young
deep down i must have always known
that is would be inevitable
to earn my <unk> i'd have to pay
and bear my soul

i know i'm not the only one
who regrets the things they've done
sometimes i just feel it's only me
who can spend the reflection that they see
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky, not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air, i miss my friends
i miss my <unk> i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago

when i walk around all of the streets
where i grew up and found my feet
they can't look me in the eye
it's like they're scared of me
i try to think of things to say
like a joke or a memory
but they don't recognize me now

i tell you i hate you but i'll still let you in
you say <unk> dogs can't learn new <unk>
but on the flip flip flipside
where the right is wrong and wrong feels so right
and every single <unk> fight
only makes me love you more
i'm dreaming of the flip flip flipside
where white is black and black is snow white
and every single heartbreaking night
only makes me love you more
there may be other lovers
some might offer diamonds
some might offer me the world, i don't want them
'cause honey they're not you
you're running through my veins
i try to <unk> but you're still in my system
honey, i'm damaged goods
you broke it so you bought itsell me candy like the summer when it's <unk> in my hand
i know you're around like the ice cream man
i can hear you calling whisper something in my ear
say it like sugar tell me what i wanna hear

i'm weak by your touch when it's <unk> on my lips
a rush through my body, feel it in my finger tips
you selling me your fantasy that i wanna explore
sound so good, <unk> me rotten to the core

(chorus:)

we'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

i trusted him, but when i followed you
i saw you together
(i didn't know about you then 'till i saw you with him again)
i walked in
on your love scene
slow dancing

you feel me until everybody
say they love you, but not love
and your suit is <unk>
and the girl you fucking hates you
and your friends faded off shots of
what you <unk>
then forget about the game that you on top of
your famous girlfriend's ass getting <unk> than the <unk> does
and when you forget it, that's when she pop up
and you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
or three <unk> for niggas dressed like <unk>
and deal with the questions about all your <unk> needs
and you do <unk> at french laundry in <unk> <unk>
<unk> and glasses of dolce
that shit's right up your alley
you see a girl and you ask about her
bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
they put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
walking through airport security with your hat down
instead of getting a pat down
they just keep on saying that they feel you nigga

[the weeknd]
been faded too long, ooh
when will it stop? the ride

[drake]
you won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself in it
and tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
and steal your <unk> debit cards so you maintain an image
and ride around in <unk>
<unk> cars that ain't <unk>
you need a <unk> you got it
you know its real when your
latest nights are your greatest nights
the sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
apartment <unk> some <unk> and <unk>
when you record with two others that want the same things
it start to feel better than home feels
and so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
that champagne money was for gas and phone bills
but shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
you drop a couple songs in hopes that you could beat a nigga
and come out every night to let the city see they nigga
telling stories that nobody relate to
and even though they hate you
they just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga
it's been too long man

[the weeknd]
been faded too long, ooh
when will it stop? the ride

i haven't been inside <unk> 1 and 3 in so long
driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
that runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
and all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
for four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
what's good at home?
the same hoes are still at it, i shoulda known
my young niggas popping and sipping dirty jonessometimes, these walls seem to <unk> in on me,
but when i look in your eyes, i feel alive...
some days, we say words that don't mean a thing,
but when you're holding me tight, i feel alive...

make it last forever;
come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
you and i, together;
come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

each day, i feel so blessed to be looking at you,
'cause when you open your eyes, i feel alive...
my heart beats so damn quick when you say my name,
when i'm holding you tight, i'm so alive,
so now, let's just live it up...

make it last forever;
come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
you and i, together;
come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

baby, last forever;
come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
you and i, together;
come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, blue...

we gotta hold on...
i gotta hold on...
you've got to hold on...
you've got a hold on, a hold onto me...

we gotta hold on...you're set in stone and i never give in
i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
you say i'm selfish, i agree with you on that
i think you're giving off way too much in fact
i say we've only known each other one year
you say, "pff, i've known you longer my dear"

you like to be so close, i like to be alone
i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
but we do, but we do, but we do

i thought i knew myself, somehow you know me more
i've never known this inevitable
you're the first to make out whenever we are two
i don't know who i'd be if i didn't know you
you're so <unk> i'm so conservative
you're so adventurous, i'm so very cautious, combined
you think we would and we do, but we do, but we do, but we do

favouritism ain't my thing but
in this situation i'll be glad

favouritism ain't my thing but
i'll be glad to make an exceptionwell let me tell you a story
about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken, and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
did you know that i loved you or were you not aware?
you're the smile on my face
and i ain't going nowhere
i'm here to make you happy, i'm here to see you smile
i've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

well i can tell you're afraid of what this might do
cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
well i don't wanna lose it either
i don't think i can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
so take my hand
well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
cause i know that it pains if he's gone everytime he move over on the shoulder you crying
and i hope by the time that i'm done with this song that i figure out

who's gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
you're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
but you can't fly unless you let yourself,
you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

i will catch you if you fall
but if you spread your wings
you can fly away with me
but you can't fly unless you let your...
you can't fly unless you let yourself falljustin bieber
as long as you love me

we're under pressure
seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
keep it together
smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
but hey now, you know girl
we both know it's a cruel world
but i will take my chances

as long as you love me
we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
i'll be your platinum, i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold
as long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

i'll be your soldier
fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
i'll be your hova
you could be my destiny's child on the scene girl
so don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
just take my hand

your twisted mind is like snow on the road
your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
inside your head
in the winter of dead

i will tell you i love you
but the <unk> on your ears will cater your fears
my nose and feet are running as we start
to travel through snow
together we go

we get colder
as we grow older
we will walk
so much <unk>

oh, miss believer, my pretty <unk>right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
pulls me down, turns me weak for you
i find myself repeating like a broken tune
and i'm forever excusing your intentions
and i give in to my pretendings
which forgive you each time
without me knowing
they melt my heart to stone

and i hear your words that i made up
you say my name like there could be an us
i best tidy up my head, i'm the only one in love
i'm the only one in love

each and every time i turn around to leave
i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
so desperately i try to link it with my head
but instead i fall back to my knees
as you tear your way right through me
i forgive you once again
without me knowing
you've burnt my heart to stone

and i hear your words that i made up
you say my name like there could be an usboy you standin real close to me
tell me now what its gunna be
you like what u see

i can't seem to breathe when i am lost
in this dream, i need you to hold me
i'm scared of lonely

i cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
to wipe away these tears of mine, so i hold my pillow tight
to imagine you, i'll stretch your hand looking for mineverse 1: <unk>
my name is drizzy
and i aint perfect
and i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
aint on the fence about it
i aint mister <unk>
i go a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girl
<unk> up and superficial <unk>
who dress like <unk> jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addiction
and im the one who will feed it
but truly you bad enough
where you don't really even need it
you could show up to the party
on dirty public <unk>
and i guarantee the camera man will still be <unk> <unk>
of you and your <unk> <unk>
drinking what you get handed
with your virgin island <unk>
all looking like you just landed
i don't really understand it
im not sure im <unk>
cause these girls are having fun with who money they spending screaming

(chorus (2x))
i got to be <unk> (2x)
ay ay ay ay you don't like (2x)

(verse 2: lil wayne)
my name is <unk>
im almost perfect
and i work harder than hard working
bizarre <unk>
that's what my bars surface
there far i act a clown
even when i laying on my back im never backing down
so over stand me
i got a condo in miami
and my door <unk> is always <unk>
and i run louisiana
but i never pulled a <unk>i thought i told you he'd be home soon
couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
i fall short each time, every time he ain't here
you and your charm creep closer, closer in here
like a fool for fire i fall, with my pride and all
like a bomb before <unk> ticking by your call
you're the wiser one, <unk> from greed
and i'm just a child who belongs on her knees

but i found a boy who i love more
than i ever did you before
so stand beside the river, i cried
and let yourself down
look how you want me now that i don't need you

so, you thought that i would crumble to my knees
at the first sight of you crawling back to me
to <unk> will you leave your man?
'cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
i won't stand by you

'cause i found a boy who i love more
than i ever did you before
so stand beside the river, i cried
and let yourself downwork, work, work, work, work, work
you see me i be
you see me, do me
dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
for some of that
work, work, work, work, work, work
for you i got
love, love, love, love, love, love
when i came for my
turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

join me, i deserved it
no time to have you lurking
if i got right then you might like it
you know i dealt with you the <unk>
nobody touch me, i'm the <unk>
nobody text me in a crisis

i believed all of your dreams are fruition
you took my heart and my keys and my vision
you took my heart off my sleeve, a decoration
you mistaken my love i brought for you for foundation

all that i wanted from you was to give me
something that i never had
something that you've never seen
something that you've never been

but i wake up and everything's wrong
just get ready for work, work, work, work, work, work
you see me i be
work, work, work, work, work, work
you see me, do me
dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
for some of that
work, work, work, work, work, work

duh, duh, duh, duh
for you i got
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
before the tables turned, turned, turned, turned

'cause sooner or later
we'll wonder why we gave up
the truth is everyone knows

almost, almost is never enough
so close to being in love
if i would have known that you wanted me
the way i wanted you
then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
but right here in each other's arms

and we almost, we almost knew what love was
but almost is never enough

if i could change the world <unk>
<unk> be no such thing as goodbye
you'd be standing right where you were
and we'd get the chance we deserve

try to deny it as much as you want
but in time our feelings will show

'cause sooner or later
we'll wonder why we gave up
the truth is everyone knows

almost, almost is never enough
we were so close to being in love

there's not enough wind in oklahoma
to rip the nails out of the past

shatter every window till it's all blown away
every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

she heard those <unk> screaming out
her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
she locked herself in the <unk> listened to the screaming of the wind
some people called it taking <unk> she called it sweet revenge

shatter every window till it's all blown away
every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

welcome to this christmas;
only comes one time a year, don't miss this...
i just wanna welcome you to christmas;i know where you stand
silent in the trees
and that's where i am
why won't you speak
where i happen to be?
silent in the trees
standing cowardly

i can feel your breath
i can feel my death
i want to know you
i want to see
i want to say

hello, hello, hello, hello
i know where you stand
silent in the trees
and that's where i am
why won't you speak
where i happen to be?
silent in the trees
standing cowardly
there's a dream in my soul
a fire that's deep inside me
there's a me no one knows
waiting to be set free

i'm gonna see that day
i can feel it
i can taste it
change is coming my way

i was born to be somebody
ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
i'll light up the sky like lightning
i'm gonna rise above
show 'em what i'm made of
i was born to be somebody
i was born to be
and this world will belong to me

this life can kick you around (whoa)
this world can make you feel small (whoa)
they will not keep me down (whoa)
i was born to stand tall

i'm goin' all the way
i can feel it, i believe it
i'm here, i'm here to stay

i was born to be somebody
ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me

i'll light up the sky like lighting
i'm gonna rise above
show 'em what i'm made of
i was born to be somebody
i was born to be
and this world will belong to me

feel iti told, i told, i told myself again
i'm never running back on what i said
trying not to roam but you're so
far away, so far away

won't listen to the conscience in my head
i'm conscious but i'm lonely, halfway dead
tired of the things you <unk>
you never said, you never said

our love was made to rule the world
you came and broke the perfect girl

you left me wanting what we were

forget forever
forget you ever
knew my name, my name, my name, my name

i know, i know, i know we can't pretend
that we were never lovers in the end
i try to tell myself this pain <unk>
go away...just go away!who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
you get excitement in your bones
and everything you do's a game
when night comes and you're on your own
you can say i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
it's harder when you're on top

'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

who wants to be riding high
when you'll just crumble back on down
you give up everything you are
and even then you don't get far
they make believe that everything
is exactly what it seems
but at least when you're at your worst
you know how to feel things

see when hard work don't pay off
and i'm tired, there ain't
no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we won't be making up
i've cried my heart out
and now i've had enough of love

go ahead and steal my heart
to make me cry again
'cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
when we were both right
and no one had blame
but now i give up
on this endless game

'cause who wants to be right as rain
it's better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my bonesi love you, need you
need you to stay

girl you're on my mind like 24/7
every single time that i'm not with you
if you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

i feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
she give me butterflies and they won't go away
under the stars, she took my hand and said
"love, you, need you, need you here to <unk>

i'd like to give you what you need
i try but you're makin' it hard for me
how do i make you believe?
cause i love you, need you, need you here to stay

i'd like to give you what you need
i try but you're makin' it hard for me
how do i make you believe?
cause i love you, need you, need you here to stay

every time you're <unk> girl somethin' is missin'
and wish that i could fix it, i wish things were different
what else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

i feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
she give me butterflies and they won't go away
under the stars, she took my hand and said
"love, you, need you, need you here to <unk>

i'd like to give you what you need
i try but you're makin' it hard for me
how do i make you believe?
cause i love you, need you, need you here to stay

i'd like to give you what you need

how do i make you believe?
cause i love you, need you, need you here to stay

is this what you want? the <unk> the baddest
i know what you want, without askin'
i hit once, have to have it, hit it twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
i heard that it's <unk> outside, let's do that on the <unk>
i just keep <unk> is it real, is it <unk> look, tell me, is it <unk>
<unk> real enough to go and get it <unk>i will leave my heart at the door
i won't say a word
they've all been said before, you know
so why don't we just play pretend
like we're not scared of what is coming next
or scared of having nothing left

look, don't get me wrong
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again?

i don't need your honesty
it's already in your eyes
and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
no one knows me like you do
and since you're the only one that matters
tell me who do i run to?

look, don't get me wrong
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do what lovers dotake a breath, take it deep
calm yourself, he says to me
if you play, you play for keeps
take the gun, and count to three
i'm sweating now, moving slow
no time to think, my turn to go

and you can see my heart beating
you can see it through my chest
and i'm terrified but i'm not leaving
i know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)

say a prayer to yourself
he says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
and then i get, a scary thought
that he's here, means he's never lost

and you can see my heart beating
you can see it through my chest
said i'm terrified but i'm not leaving
i know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger

as my life flashes before my eyes
i'm wondering will i ever see another sunrise
so many won't get the chance to say goodbyei told you once, get out my life
i don't need ya, i'll be alright
but some things are better left unsaid

to tell the truth, it hit me hard
a broken heart is all i have now
but some things are better left unsaid

and i swore that i would never say
i miss you more every day
but some things are better left unsaid

[verse 1]
i can't believe i believed everything we had would last
so young and naive of me to think she was from your past
silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

i can't believe i fell for your <unk> i'm smarter than that
so dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
it took me some time but now i moved on
because i realized i got

[chorus]
me, myself and i that's all i got in the end
that's what i found out
and there ain't no need to cry
i took a vow that from now on
i will be my own best friend

[repeat chorus]
so controlling to say that you love me but you don't
your family told me one day i would see it on my own
next thing i know i'm dealing with your three kids in my home
love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
took me some time but now i am strong
because i realized i got

[chorus]
[repeat chorus]
[bridge]
got me, myself and i
(i know that i will never disappoint myself)
i must have cried a thousand times(verse 1)
baby boy what you done to me
i saw you smiling suddenly
i can't get you out my mind
i got a bad boy i can't lie
i want your time and your full attention
i wanna to talk to you and not to mention good love that you give to me i think about it constantly no i
won't apologize for feeling like i do it's just the simple facts of life im crazy over you

(chorus)
im a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day im addicted to what your giving me boy
it's killing me when it comes to love im not trying share you might think im greedy but i just don't care
i need you in my world cause im a selfish girl

(verse 2)
i understand that you got your crew but i've got something in mind for you make you lose all track of
time guaranteed to blow your mind i don't care what anybody got to say maybe they never had it quite this
way let them talk and <unk> they all need to recognize they might see im a bit extreme to need you
night and day but what i feel can't be consealed there ain't no other way

(chorus)
im a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day im addicted to what your giving me boy
it's killing me when it comes to love im not trying share you might think im greedy but i just don't care
i need you in my world cause im a selfish girl
(verse 1)
what's up?
i know we haven't <unk> for a while
but i was thinkin' 'bout you
and it kinda made me smile
so many things to say
and i'll put 'em in a letter
and it might be easier
the words might come out better
how's your <unk> how's your little brother,
does he still look just like you?
so many things i wanna know the answers to
wish i could press rewind
and <unk> every line
to the story of me and you

(chorus)
don't you know i've tried and i've tried
to get you out my mind
but it don't get no better
as each day goes by
and i'm lost and confused
i've got nothin' to lose
hope to hear from you soon
p.s. i'm still not over you
still not over you

(verse 2)
excuse me, i really didn't mean to <unk> on
but there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
i guess you thought that i would put it all behind me
but it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
like a silly joke, or somethin' on the <unk>
boy it ain't easy
when i hear our song
i get that same old feeling
wish i could press rewind
turn back the hands of time
and i shouldn't be telling you

(chorus)
don't you know i've tried and i've tried
to get you out my mind
but it don't get no better
as each day goes by
and i'm lost and confused<div class="lyricbox">nine... four... eight... one.

<unk> your heart for me

'cause <unk> condition just means that you haven't been living
who taught you to be so safe anyways?
a scar is just a battle <unk> it tells the <unk> of <unk> days
before cold feet, cold feet
can't tell you your heart won't get broken, but
c'mon now - throw some caution to the wind
i'm throwing it to the wind
you could run away scared
or look it straight in the eye
and tell it "i don't want you coming here no <unk>

skinned knees and <unk> <unk>
the world <unk> oh honey, honey, <unk>

how you can stand there is beyond me

all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my "let's just be friends" are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need family for
'cause i can't depend on you anymore

always saw you for what you could've been
ever since you met me
like when <unk> made that one car that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you could've been
and even when it's business with you it's personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet and now we're <unk> our end

and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

you're so predictable i hate people like you
kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
how you supposed to figure out what i'm going through
you can't even figure out what's going on with you
you judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
i make all the <unk> <unk> for the real niggas
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
out here in l.a. i don't know what's going on
i don't know what's going on

and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

you sit and you pray hoping that the stars <unk>
my luck is a sure thing 'cause i'm living right
when i needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
i'm <unk> and <unk> them all like i'm working for <unk> wage
someone up there must just love testing my patience
someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
forgiveness for your waysmafia

he's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in
because i'm gone again
and to him i just can't be true

and i know that he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door,
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer

i feel it in the air
as i'm doing my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
as he <unk>
ask if i'm gonna be out late

i say i won't be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie i didn't have to tell
because we both know
where i'm about to go
and we know it very well

'cause i know that he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymorei know it's hard but

i thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'cause all those other women couldn't care less if i lived
and i'm not barely trippin' i just can't do this again
please don't tell me you're just like them

and when the church doors opened up wide
she put her <unk> down trying to hide the tears
oh she just couldn't believe it
she heard the <unk> from the <unk> band
and the flowers fell out of her hand

baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
everybody's saying, he's not coming home now,
this can't be happening to me
this is just a dream

the preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
lord please lift his soul and heal this <unk>
then the congregation all stood up and sang
the <unk> song, that she ever heard
and then they handed her a <unk> up flag

and she held on to all she had left of him
oh and what could've been
and then the guns <unk> one last shot
and it felt like a bullet in her heart

baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever, now i'll never know
i can't even breathe

that after this fever i'll survive
i know i'm acting a bit crazy
<unk> out, a little bit hazy
hand over heart, i'm praying
that i'm gonna make it out alive

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice 'cause i won't hear
you might be right but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

you got me <unk> in pieces
shining like stars and screaming
lighting me up like <unk>
but then you disappear and make me wait
and every <unk> like torture
<unk> drip, no more so
finding a way to let go
baby, baby no i can't escape

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice 'cause i won't hear
you might be right but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

i've never been so caught up, still so into <unk>
i never thought i'd be here - should've turned to <unk>
ooh, let's be honest, baby: this is so <unk>
ooh, and i'm not <unk> baby, even if they're beautiful...

i used to be cautious, a little too reckless,
now all my emotions are all cause of you...

i ain't even think of leaving sometimes, i ain't even think of letting go;
i ain't ever thought of going nowhere, i don't even see it down the road...
cause we're collecting moments, tattoos on my mind;
i ain't even think of leaving sometimes, i ain't even think of letting go,
not even sometimes...

la, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la...

ooh, let's be honest, baby: this is so <unk>
ooh, and i'm not <unk> baby, even if they're beautiful...

it used to be easy for someone to steal me;
now all my emotions are all cause of you, boy...

i ain't even think of leaving sometimes, i ain't even think of letting go;
i ain't ever thought of going nowhere, i don't even see it down the road...
'cause we're collecting moments, tattoos on my mind;
i ain't even think of leaving sometimes, i ain't even think of letting go,
not even sometimes, babe...

i don't know, i don't know, i don't know why it never <unk> but it's going to <unk>
you don't know, you don't know, you don't know what it does to me when i feel you around...
is it love? is it <unk> is it <unk> but it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there,
hard to breathe when you're kissing me there, hard to breathe... when you're not here...[drake - verse 1]

[nicki minaj]
i mean we don't even rock them shoes
if it don't got a <unk> on the price <unk>
i mean, i mean but then againwhen the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i will never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong

i'd go hungry, i'd go black and blue
and i'd go crawling down the avenue
no there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
i got my eyes on you, you're everything that i see
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly
i can't get over you, you left your mark on me

'cause you're a good girl and you know it
you act so different around me
i know exactly who you could be

just hold on we're going home
it's hard to do these things alone

i got my eyes on you, you're everything that i see
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly
i can't get over you, you left your mark on me

'cause you're a good girl and you know it
you act so different around me
i know exactly who you could be

just hold on we're going home
it's hard to do these things alone
some say
i'll be better without you
but they don't know you like i do
or at least the sides i thought i knew

i can't bear this time
it <unk> on as i lose my mind
reminded by things i find
like notes and clothes you've left behind

wake me up
wake me up when all is done
i won't rise until this <unk> won
my <unk> become undone

but i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

so petrified
i'm so scared to step into this ride
what if i lose my heart and fail the <unk>
i won't forgive me if i give up trying

i heard his voice today
i didn't know a single word he said
not one <unk> to the man i met
just a <unk> and broken boy instead

but i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i am willing to take the risk

there will be times we'll try and give it up
<unk> at the seams, no doubt
we'll almost fall apart, then burn the pieces
to watch them turn to <unk> but nothing will ever <unk> us

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i'm willing to take the risk

i won't go
i can't do it on my own
if this ain't love, then what is?
i am willing to take the risk

<div <unk> a minute since we've slept together

thinking we gon' hit your friend if you <unk> to date
claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
but y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[drake:]
uh, el' be saying that i'm <unk> i'm hella nice
for that i've been approached to sign to <unk> twice
haters tell you all the rumors they heard
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like i'm ellen <unk>
my groove <unk> is that when you too <unk>
they try to bring you down to the level they at
well when they are all <unk> then it gets a little sticky
that's why i am little <unk> to these devils in rap
but, uh, they ain't thinking drake get smart girl
nah, they probably think i'll break your heart girl
<unk> i can't lie, you probably right about it
and if you give me the ass quick, i'll probably write about it
but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound
i mean i spit that influential shit from my town
i don't know why you sitting on the couch
when you see i got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
you think taking your purse off
will lead to me, you taking <unk> off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i could've been a local <unk>
and you probably would've been worse off
so i'm a take this hat off, and i'm a hit it till i backs off
and then i'm back <unk>
cause you thinking you can <unk> what happen
you the reason i'm thinking i'm getting sick of rapping

[chorus]
<unk>
you probably think i walk around with my gun <unk> and
<unk> dick to these hoes like <unk>
well, you can think what you want but
i think you've been watching too much <unk> <unk>
you need to get real and check out my real life
i ain't a <unk> don't care what it smell like
but if you feel like putting all your <unk> aside
and talking to a real nigga, i'd gladly <unk>
first name <unk> i'd be <unk> to date ya
college <unk> got <unk> in papers
but i'm from the south where if you ain't <unk>

who's that chick? who's that chick?on the first day of christmas
when you gave me all them kisses
boy, you showed me things
come hold me please, and never let me go
on the second day of christmas
said you felt like something's missing
so you promised me
that promise ring to keep 'til we get <unk> boy

on the third day of christmas
we got all in our feelings
said i love you and meant it (ah, ah, ah)
on the fourth we committed
any time, he could get it
he's the real one, i know it

look at all the things my true love gave to me
my true love, my true love
you are my true love
look at all the things my true love gave to me
my true love, my true love
you are my true love
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

on the fifth day of christmas
you asked me what's on my <unk>
and i told you all i wanted was forever with my boo
after six days in your arms
i got a tattoo on my heart
cause i'm your moonlight, you're my star
and nothing's shining more than you, boy
now that i have captured your attention
i want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
mr. t say i'm ready for inspection
show me how you make a first impression

oh, oh
can we take it nice and slow, slow
break it down and drop it low, low
cause i just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

i just wanna feel your body right next to mine
all night long
baby, slow down the song
and when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
all night long
baby, slow down the song

if you want me i'm accepting applications
so long as we keep this record on <unk>
you know i'm good with mouth to mouth <unk>
breathe me in, breathe me out
so amazing

break it down and drop it low, low
cause i just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

baby, slow down the song
and when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
all night long
baby, slow down the song

breathe me in, breathe me out
the music's got me goingi wake up fine and dandy
but then by the time i find it handy
to rip my heart apart and start
planning my crash landing
i go up, up, up, up
up to the ceiling
then i feel my soul start leaving
like an old man's hair <unk>

i'm <unk> please, oh please
on my knees repeatedly asking
why it's got to be like this?
is this living free?
i don't want to be the one, be the one
who has the sun's blood on my hands, i'll tell the moon
take this weapon forged in darkness
some see a pen, i see a harpoon

i'll stay awake
'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

why am i not scared in the morning?
i don't hear those voices calling
i must've kicked them out

i swear i heard demons yelling
those crazy words they were spelling
they told me i was gone

but i'll tell them
why won't you let me go?
do i threaten all your plans?
i'm insignificant
please tell them
you have no plans for me
i will set my soul on fire
what have i become?
i'll tell them

on the eve of a day
that's forgotten and fake
as the <unk> they await
and clouds anticipate
the start of a day
when we put on our face
a mask that <unk>
that we don't need grace

on the eve of a day
that is bigger than us
but we open our eyes
'cause we're told that we must
and the trees wave their arms
and the clouds try to plead
desperately yelling
there's something we need

i'm not free
i asked forgiveness three times
same amount that i denied
i <unk> <unk> this crime
i'm afraid to tell you who i adore
won't tell you what i'm sing towards
metaphorically, i'm a <unk>
and that's denial number four

i'll stay awake
