a lot of pent up aggression coming out of my <unk>
ovo on me while y'all niggas was playing <unk>
and i know who gon' take the fall with me
they right here on call with me, they all with me
you could throw <unk> balls but i got the <unk> fitted
they been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
i worked at <unk> connections whenever jason let me
i was buying <unk> everyday
<unk> <unk> trying not to catch a stray
i dropped out right before i graduate
six <unk> left, my mama had her <unk> day
"it's only up from here, i promise, you just gotta <unk>
and she took my word for it, that's all i had to say
lately i just feel so out of character
the <unk> can start to turn into <unk>
thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a <unk>
i get a blank page when i try to draw a <unk>
i'm getting straight to the point with it
need y'all to know that i never needed none of y'all niggas
fuck being all buddy buddy with the <unk>
it's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
but i haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
my niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
who you think running this <unk>
you saw it in me at 20 years old
the <unk> start to sound like we talking in code
i got a pure soul, i don't do the hate
you don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
me and niko used to <unk> on how to make a change
now me and kobe doing shots the night before the game
still drop 40 with liquor in my system
numbers going <unk> just to <unk> some distance
i might see you on and off but i'll never switch ya
niggas quick to double cross like both of us christian
<unk> got me feeling like i'm christian <unk>
and i never bend my <unk> for the ticket <unk>
tipping <unk> bars heavy like triple <unk>
i never <unk> no one in, i'd rather get you myself
running through the <unk> <unk> through the <unk>
i'm <unk> you can see it under the contacts
they think i had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
i still got something left to prove since you left me room
paint a plan for the family <unk> we in the minus
and like it's going in a <unk> i put it all behind us
where you tryna go? i got it, i'll take us wherever
i'm a <unk> in the game, all my papers together
and my life is on display like <unk>
they wanna pree the <unk> gotta start to make 'em sooner
my exes made some of my favorite music
i dated women from my favorite movies
<unk> such a thing of beauty
i'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
it's far <unk> like i threw that shit a hundred <unk>
i keep it 100 like i'm running a fever
i might take a <unk> but i won't ever leave you
if i was you, i wouldn't like me <unk>i let it fall, my heart
and as it fell, you rose to claim it
it was dark, and i was over
until you kissed my lips and you saved me

my hands, they were strong
but my knees were far too weak
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet

but there's a side to you that i never knew, never knew
all the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
and the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
let it burn while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name, your name

when i lay with you
i could stay there, close my eyes
feel you here, forever
you and me together, nothing is better

'cause there's a side to you that i never knew, never knew
all the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
and the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
let it burn while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name, your name

i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when we fell, something died
'cause i knew that that was the last time, the last time

sometimes i wake up by the door
that heart you caught must be waiting for you
even now when we're already over
i can't help myself from looking for you

i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
let it burn while i cried
'cause i heard it screaming out your name, your name

i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when we fell, something died
'cause i knew that that was the last time, the last time

and there is something 'bout the way you love me
that finally feels like home
all my life, you're my darkness
you're the right kind of madness
and you're my hope, you're my despair
you're my <unk> everything, everywhere

hitting me like an explosion
all of my life, i've been frozen
the sweetest devotion i've known

[outro: beyonce]
i see your face and a
you wanna touch it and,
come to my place and we
can discuss it..hollywood,
welcome to hollywood.i know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
we belong

lately, you make me feel all i am is a <unk> plan
i'll say i'm done and then you smile at me and i'll forget
everything i <unk>

i buy into those eyes and into your lies
chorus
you say you'll call, but i know you
you say you're coming home, but i know you
you say you'll call, but i know you won't.

i wish you were where you're supposed to be
close to me
but here i am just staring at this candle burning out
still no sound

of footsteps on my stairs
your voice anywhere

chorus
you say you'll call, but i know you
you say you're coming home, but i know you
you say you'll call, but i know you won't.

you say you'll call, but i know you
you say you're coming home, but i know you
you say you'll call, but i know you won't.
you better take it from me
that boy is like a disease
you run and you try, and you're tryin' to hide
and you're wondering why you can't get free

he's like a <unk> he's like a drug
you get addicted to his love
you wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'cause you can't live without one more touch

he's a good-time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water
but he's candy-coated misery

he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
you better run for your life

i see that look on your face
you ain't hearing what i say
so i'll say it again, 'cause i been where you been
and i know how it ends, you can't get away

don't even look in his eyes
he'll tell you nothing but lies
and you wanna believe but you won't be deceived
if you listen to me and take my advice

he's a good-time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water
but he's candy-coated misery

he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
you better run for your life

run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind
he'll tell you anything you wanna hear
he'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
but just remember

he's a good-time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water
but he's candy-coated misery

he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
you better run for your life
oh, you better run for your lifei'm taking over my body
back in control, no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost
"t"s uncrossed and "i"s undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot
like flesh is all i got
not any more, flesh out the door, swat

i must've forgot, you can't trust me
i'm open a moment and close when you show it
before you know it i'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it
and the story unfolds
you should take my life
you should take my soul

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment
you know exactly where you're going
'cause the next moment, before you know it
time is slowing and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?

fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
to a tree, tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me"

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith



lean with it, rock with it

there's times when i might blow like <unk> on a vacation
for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience

i got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me

i'm trying to tell you just how
i'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
say that it's always been me

that's made you feel a way you've never felt before
and i'm all you need and that you never want more
then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
but you'd save the best for last
like i'm the one for you

you should know that you're just a temporary fix
this is not <unk> with you, it don't mean that much to me
you're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
how dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

why is it every time i think i've tried my hardest
it turns out it ain't enough cause you're still not <unk> love
what am i supposed to do to make you want me <unk>
i'm taking these chances and getting away
and though i'm trying my hardest you go back to her
and i think that i know things may never change
i'm still hoping one day i might hear you say

i make you feel a way you've never felt before
and i'm all you need and you never want more
then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
but you'd save the best for last
like i'm the one for you

you should know that you're just a temporary fix
this is not <unk> with you, it don't mean that much to me
you're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
how dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

but, despite the truth i know
i find it hard to let go and give up on you
seems i love the things you do
like the <unk> you treat me the more eager i am
to <unk> with this heartbreak and running around
and i will until i find myself with you and

and make you feel a way you've never felt before
and be all you need so that you never want more
and we'll say all of the right things without a clue
and you'll be the one for me and me the one for youfound the truth beneath your lies
and true love never has to hide
true love never has to hide
i'll trade your broken wings for mine
trade your broken wings for mine

looking in the mirror embarrassed
feeling like a suicidal <unk>
<unk> like an infant whenever you are <unk>
mind over matter never worked for my <unk>
in the matter of man arm <unk>
hands i was dealt when i said the music business was all i needed
when i got it i was <unk> by an <unk>
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction that would keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend
my <unk> is <unk> women love when you're my type
and you're winning from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel, sin city
devil in a dress, platinum chanel
live the <unk> all cause the audience
one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse being read
i'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
<unk> that, and your <unk> look good with the indian tracks
<unk> <unk> on your used 5 <unk>
i call back just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say were in the area <unk> in toronto
hit me on the <unk> thought he was gonna sell me a false word
like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks, located where you see us
a white <unk> on standby when we need her
a black <unk> 40 pulled up <unk>
no doors all that nigga was missing was <unk>
felt like the <unk>
a reality living in the matrix
we talk <unk> about the industry
and how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
then he said that he was the same age as myself
and it help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
so blame it on mr. <unk> the reason why breathing all the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why, the <unk> was when he <unk>
you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of <unk> full of fame
and <unk> yourself alive, then i <unk>she don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
she don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
and she getting to the point where it's too much for
and she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
she can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
don't want no love in front of the camera

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

she's giving <unk> she don't like this live
she said if i loved her, i'd give it up won't think twice
i can't do that
and it's getting to the point where it's too much for
wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
she don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
don't want no love in front of the camera

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don't

why can i choose between the two
one of the nights i'll run right now
i wish she could see, how good this can be
i hope she waits a little bit longer
cause i don't wanna live life, without her by my side
cause she gets the light that is in me
but she don't know, she don't know

she don't like the lights
she don't, she don't, she don'tlately, nothing i do ever seems to please you
and maybe turning my back would be that much <unk>
cause <unk> words are all that we exchange
but i can't watch you walk away
could i forget about the way it feels to touch you?
and all about the good times that we've been <unk>
could i wake up without you everyday, would i let you walk away?

no i can't learn to live without
and i can't give up on us now.

chorus:
oh, i know i could say we're through
and tell myself i'm over you
but even if i made a vow
a promise not to miss you
now and try to hide the truth inside
i fail cause i just can't live a lie

could i forget the look that tells me that you want me?
and all the reasons that make loving you so easy,
the kiss that always makes it hard to breathe,
the way you know just what i mean,

no i can't learn to live <unk> oh,
so don't you give up on us now.

and i don't wanna try
when i try to hide the truth inside
i fail cause i just can't live a lie
i can't live a liesometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad
it cuts through the deepest parts of me
and fills up my mouth with words that i cry
how i'm still trying to stay inside

hearts break and hearts wait
to make us grow from dust
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
so that we know that it hurts

our hearts break and hearts wait
to make us grow from dust
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
so that we know that it hurts

every now and then my memories <unk>
with the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
but as time goes on and my age gets older
i love the ones i know, they're enough to picture the rain

'cause heart break and hearts wait
to make us grow from dust
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
so that we know that it hurts

our hearts break and hearts wait
to make us grow from dust

and i think that i just realized what it means

<unk> <unk>

what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these <unk> <unk> wanna cover me
and you makin' it seem that it happened that way because of me
but i was curious and i'll never forget it baby
what an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious

there was smoke in the air before now it's me clearin' it
that felt good, all and all i learned a lesson from it though
you never see it comin' you just get to see it go
yeah, i shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now i can see it in her eyes
fireworks

[chorus]
oh, today it begins
i've missed them before, but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means

[drake - verse 3]
everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen
and he's still got his foot out, <unk> trippin'
it's been years, though, i just learned to deal with it

for real, me and my <unk> we built up a better <unk>
got my mother in a place with some better <unk>
she <unk> the entire city i let her explore
and now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before

yeah, but i guess i gotta find it first
<unk> why i'm really goin' off, fireworks

'cause sooner or later
we'll wonder why we gave up
the truth is everyone knows

almost, almost is never enough
so close to being in love
if i would have known that you wanted me
the way i wanted you
then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
but right here in each other's arms

and we almost, we almost knew what love was
but almost is never enough

if i could change the world <unk>
<unk> be no such thing as goodbye
you'd be standing right where you were
and we'd get the chance we deserve

try to deny it as much as you want
but in time our feelings will show

'cause sooner or later

the truth is everyone knows

almost, almost is never enough
we were so close to being in love

since cassie <unk> disappeared
and me and my <unk> <unk> been in all the <unk>
every day for <unk> on a year
they say we got tangled in a love <unk>
a fatal game of truth or dare

but the truth <unk> a <unk> and now it's <unk> history
it's a choctaw county affair
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (choctaw county affair)

well, cassie <unk> was no southern lady
despite all the <unk> hype
they all loved to make her out like a sweet little <unk>
all-american <unk> type
but her mind was <unk>
she was greedy, she was <unk>
strutting 'round with her nose in the air

she was a cold <unk> <unk> a hand trigger
it's a choctaw county affair
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
and now they say she's lying dead somewhere (choctaw county affair)

well, i do not deny i wished cassie would die
when she threatened us with <unk>
she said she had some <unk> that would wreck my reputation
and land bobby back in jail
now it's best to remember bobby <unk> got a <unk>
like a <unk> <unk> bear

but there's nobody, there's no witness
so y'all go mind your business
it's a choctaw county affair
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
oh, you mess with bobby and you better <unk> (choctaw county affair),
yeah <unk> hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
when they put us on the witness stand
they thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
we were <unk> hand in hand
and that fancy <unk> from down jackson way
said he'd see us in the <unk> chair, ha

but the <unk> of the <unk> told me "honey, don't you <unk>
it's a choctaw county <unk> yeah
(choctaw county affair)
yeah, it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair), yeah
how would you know 'cause you weren't there? (choctaw county affair)
yeah, it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
yeah, yeah (choctaw county affair)<div class="lyricbox">[intro]

trying to do better than good

the people i don't have the time to hang with
look at me and say the same shit
(they say)
you promised me you would never change huh huh huh oh
you promised me you would never oh, huh huh huh huh, oh

[drake - verse 2]

and i'll be acting like i don't know how to work a

that nothing really comes as a surprise right
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now
