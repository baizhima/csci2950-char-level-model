i'm out on my own again
face down in the porcelain
feeling so high but looking so low
party favors on the floor
group of girls banging on the door
so many new fair-weather friends

oh, oh, oh
have you ever been so lost?
known the way and still so lost?

caught in the eye of a hurricane
slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
so sick of this town pulling me down, oh
my mother says i should come back home
but can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
so, if i pray, am i just sending words into outer space?

have you ever been so lost?
known the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost?

is there a light?
is there a light
at the end of the road?
i'm pushing everyone away
'cause i can't feel this anymore
can't feel this anymore

have you ever been so lost?
know the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost?<div class="lyricbox">i heard you're feeling

you're in then you're out
you're up then you're down

you're wrong when it's right

(you) but you don't really wanna go-o
you're hot then you're cold
you're yes then you're no
you're in then you're out
you're up then you're down

we used to be
just like twins, so in sync
the same energy
now's a dead battery

that you're not gonna change

'cause you're hot then you're cold
you're yes then you're no

if the fish swam out of the ocean
and grew legs and they started walking
and the apes climbed down from the trees
and grew tall and they started talking
and the stars fell out of the sky
and my tears rolled into the ocean
and now i'm looking for a reason why
you even set my world into motion

'cause if you're not really here
then the stars don't even matter
now i'm filled to the top with fear
that it's all just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not really there
then i don't wanna be either
i wanna be next to you
black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

mmm
i look up into the night sky
i see a thousand eyes staring back
and all around these golden beacons
i see nothing but black
i feel the weight of something beyond them
i don't see what i can feel
if vision is the only validation
then most of my life isn't real

'cause if you're not really here
then the stars don't even matter
now i'm filled to the top with fear
that it's all just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not really there
then i don't wanna be either
i wanna be next to you
black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
(black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold)

mmm
black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

'cause if you're not really here
then the stars don't even matter
now i'm filled to the top with fear
that it's all just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not really there
i don't wanna be either
i wanna be, next to you
black and gold, black and gold, black and goldremember when i dove into the crowd
and i got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping out
it brings back the memories
every bone's been broken
and my heart is still wide open

i can't stop
don't care if i lose
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
i'm going down in flames for you
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
one more thing i'm addicted too

with each scar there's a map that tells a story what a souvenir
of young love's like jumping out
an airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
my heart rips me wide open

i can't stop
don't care if i lose
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
i'm going down in flames for you
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
one more thing i'm addicted too

and i cover up these scars
and i can't stop seeing stars
whenever you're around
around

i can't stop
don't care if i lose
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
i'm going down in flames for you
oohhh, you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
one more thing i'm addicted to

i can't stop no i can't stop
no i can't stop
ohh, i'm going out in flames
ohh, i'm going down in flames
ohhhh
baby you are the weapon i choose
baby you are the weapon i choose...you gotta help me out
it's all a blur last night
we need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and i'm broke
i lost my fake id
but you lost the motel key

spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
you wanna cash out
and get the hell out of town
don't be a baby, remember what you told me

shut up and put your money where your mouth is
that's what you get for waking up in vegas
get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

why are these lights so bright?
did we get hitched last night?
dressed up like elvis, why am i wearing your class ring?
don't call your mother
'cause now we're partners in crime
don't be a baby, remember what you told me

shut up and put your money where your mouth is
that's what you get for waking up in vegas
get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

you got me into this
information overload, situation lost control
send out an s.o.s.
huh, and get some cash out
we're gonna tear up the town

no, don't be a baby
remember what you told me
remember what you told me, told me, told me...

hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
that's what you get for waking up in vegas
get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

that's what you get, baby
shake the glitter
shake, shake, shake the glitter
give me some cash out, babyi'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
the introduced me was always just a friend,
i bought a new dress he never noticed
always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
i'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
i think i'm ready to be a woman

oh love
i think i'm ready, ready for it

you were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
said i was pretty and i believed it
not really used to all this attention

told myself i don't deserve you
and this is just a phase
could i get used to being loved the right way
i want to argue but there is nothing to say

oh love
i think i'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
oh love i think i'm ready

'cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
yeah we talk for hours, you still want to listen
won't hold it against me if i just need you to hold me tonight
my mother always told me that you'd show up one day
(so scared) to feel this way

but love
i think i'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
oh love
oh love i think i'm ready
