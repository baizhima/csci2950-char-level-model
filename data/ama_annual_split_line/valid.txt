whenever you remember i'll be there
i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and there's nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space 'cause
i'm still stuck in the moment with you

see like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
baby we both have the right to disagree
and i ain't with it
and i don't wanna be so old and gray
reminiscing 'bout these better days
but convince just telling us to let go
so we'll never know

i wish we had another time
i wish we had another place
'cause everything we did
and everything we have is stuck in the moment
i've given too much of myself
and now it's driving me crazy
(i'm crying out for <unk>
