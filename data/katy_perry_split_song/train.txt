this was never the way i planned, not my intention
i got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
it's not what i'm used to, just wanna try you on
i'm curious for you caught my attention

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend don't mind it

it felt so wrong, it felt so right
don't mean i'm in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

no, i don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
you're my experimental game, just human nature
it's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
my head gets so confused, hard to obey

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend don't mind it

it felt so wrong, it felt so right
don't mean i'm in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

us girls we are so magical
soft skin, red lips, so kissable
hard to resist, so touchable
too good to deny it
ain't no big deal, it's innocent

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend don't mind it

it felt so wrong, it felt so right
don't mean i'm in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked itthe weight of my words are like feathers from a bird
my mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing
'cause i've dug myself deep, i managed to fit both my hands and feet
all my little white lies smell like a big old bucket of bleach
in one ear and out your other
so lock and key, you won't open up for me

so brick by brick, i am breaking through these walls
oh, between you and me
i'm not giving up
i'm not giving up on us

and it feels like you're in china and i am in peru
whenever i am sleeping next to you
we can hear the crickets singing
oh, all throughout the night
oh boy, can't you just get used to something so right?
and sure i confess: i'm a mess, i'm a mess of mistakes
but please count to ten before you go and throw it all away

so brick by brick, i am breaking through these walls
oh, between you and me
i'm not giving up
i'm not giving up on us

'cause if you give up, then what am i supposed to do?
all of our dreams never will come true without you

so brick by brick, i am breaking through these walls
oh, between you and me
i'm not giving up, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
i'm not giving, giving up
oh baby, don't give up on this love<div class="lyricbox">greetings, loved ones
let's take a journey
the one
baby you're a
california girls

let's go all the way tonight
no regrets, just love
we can dance until we die
you and i, we'll be young forever

you make me feel like i'm living a teenage dream
the way you turn me on, i can't sleep
let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

my heart stops, when you look at me
just one touch, now baby, i believe this is real
so take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

a get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
be your teenage dream tonight
let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans

i know a place
where the grass is really greener
warm, wet, and wild
there must be something in the water

you could travel the world
but nothing comes close to the golden coast
once you party with us, you'll be falling in love

california girls, we're unforgettable
daisy dukes, bikinis on top
sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

california girls, we're undeniable
fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
west coast represent, now put your hands up

in another life i would be your girl
we'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i don't have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

the one

in another life i would make you stay
so i don't have to say you were the one that got away

there's a stranger in my bed
there's a pounding my head
glitter all over the room
pink flamingos in the pool

i smell like a minibar
dj's passed out in the yard
barbies on the barbecue
is this a hickey or a bruise?

pictures of last night
ended up online
i'm screwed
oh well

it's a blacked-out blur
but i'm pretty sure
it ruled
damn

last friday night
yeah, we danced on tabletops
and we took too many shots
think we kissed but i forgot

last friday night
yeah, we maxed our credit cards
and got kicked out of the bar
so we hit the boulevard

last friday night
we went streaking in the park
skinny-dipping in the dark
then had a trois

last friday night
yeah, i think we broke the law
always say we're gonna stop
whoa!

but this friday night
do it all again

t.g.i.f.

you're so hypnotizing
could you be the devil?
could you be an angel?
your touch magnetizing
feels like i am floating
leaves my body glowing

they say be afraid
you're not like the others
futuristic lover
different dna
they don't understand you

you're from a whole 'nother world
a different dimension
you open my eyes
and i'm ready to go
lead me into the light

kiss me, kiss me
infect me with your lovin'
fill me with your poison
take me, take me
wanna be your victim
ready for abduction

boy, boy, you're an alien
your touch so foreign
it's supernatural
extraterrestrial

do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind, wanting to start again
do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
like a house of cards, one blow from caving in

do you ever feel already buried deep
six-feet-under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there's still a chance for you
'cause there's a spark in you

you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the fourth of july

'cause baby you're a firework
come on, show 'em what you're worth
make 'em go "ah, ah, ah!"
as you shoot across the sky

boom, boom, boom
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon</div>this is the last time you say
after the last line you break
it's not even a holiday
nothing to celebrate

you give a hundred reasons why
and say you're really gonna try
if i had a nickel for every time
i'd own the bank

thought that i was the exception
i could rewrite your addiction
you coulda been the greatest
but you rather get wasted

you fall asleep during foreplay
'cause the pills you take are more your forte
i'm not sticking around to watch you go down
wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
can't be your savior, i don't have the power
i'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

you say it helps you write your rhymes
whatever helps you sleep at night
you become what you despise
a stereotype

you think you're so rock 'n roll
but you're really just a joke
had the world in the palm of your hands
but you fucking choked

shoulda been my teammate
coulda changed your fate
you say that you love me
you won't remember in the morning

you fall asleep during foreplay
'cause the pills you take are more your forte
i'm not sticking around to watch you go down
wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
can't be your savior, i don't have the power
i'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

you fall asleep during foreplay
'cause the pills you take are more your forte
i'm not sticking around to watch you go down
wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
can't be your savior, i don't have the power
i'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

you're going down, you're going down, you're going down

you fall asleep during foreplay
'cause the pills you take are more your forte
i'm not sticking around to watch you go downcomparisons are easily done
once you've had a taste of perfection
like an apple hanging from a tree
i picked the ripest one, i still got the seed

you said move on, where do i go?
i guess second best is all i will know

'cause when i'm with him, i am thinking of you
thinking of you, what you would do
if you were the one who was spending the night
oh, i wish that i was looking into your eyes

you're like an indian summer in the middle of winter
like a hard candy with a surprise center
how do i get better once i've had the best?
you said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters i will test

he kissed my lips, i taste your mouth
oh, he pulled me in, i was disgusted with myself

'cause when i'm with him, i am thinking of you
thinking of you, what you would do
if you were the one who was spending the night
oh, i wish that i was looking into...

you're the best, and yes i do regret
how i could let myself let you go
now, now the lesson's learned
i touched and i was burned
oh, i think you should know

'cause when i'm with him, i am thinking of you
thinking of you, what you would do
if you were the one who was spending the night
oh, i wish that i was looking into your eyes

your eyes, looking into your eyes
looking into your eyes
oh, won't you walk through and
bust down the door and take me away
no more mistakes
'cause in your eyes i'd like to stay<div class="lyricbox">i leave the gas on
walk the alleys in the dark
sleep with candles burning
i leave the door unlocked
i'm weaving a rope and
running all the red lights
did i get your attention
i'm sending all the signs

that the clock is ticking,
and i'll be giving my two weeks
pick your favorite shade of black
you best prepare a speech
say something funny
say something sweet
but don't say that you loved me

i'm still breathing
and we've been dead for a while
this sickness has no cure
going down for sure
already lost the grip
best abandon ship, oh-oh

maybe i was too pale
maybe i was too fat
maybe you had better
better luck in the sack
no formal education
and i swore way too much
but i swear you didn't care
we were in love

so as i write this letter
and shed my last tear
all for the better
that we end this here
close this chapter
say one last prayer
but don't say that you loved me

i'm still breathing
and we've been dead for a while
this sickness has no cure
going down for sure
and we've been diagnosed
so let's give up the ghost

i'm still breathing
and we've been dead for a while
this sickness has no cure
going down for sure
already lost the grip
best abandon ship, oh-oh
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
oh i'm still breathing
i'm still breathing
oh-oh-oh-oh</div>i hope you hang yourself with your h&amp;m scarf

trying to leave you in my past.
the cd skips our favorite songs,
our greatest hits just don't belong.

i really love to hate this,
love, hate hate-love,
relationships, are over-rated.
over my dead body,
is how this will end.

you said "it's over",
and i could go for,
another chance to do,
this over again.

so this is it?
after all we've been through?
we called it quits,
and now i'm about to.
i've lost my grip,
or the little i had left.

you said "it's over",
and i could really go for,
a cup of coffee,
and an overdose.
leave it all behind me,
you'll see it,
when you finally find me,
comatose or pretty close.

cup of coffee,
and an overdose.

i pop these pills like cracker jacks,
and the price that plays dice,
just watching you react.
when your depressed you sleep too much,
i'm not sure if i'm waking up.

over my dead body,
is how this will end.

this self will bleed
killing all of my securities
lord, help me see the reality
that all ever need is you

seems to draw me near
but in the shadow of my doubt

put a battery in and make you talk
even pull a string for you
to say anything

but with you there is no guarantee
only expired warranty
a bunch of broken parts
and i can't seem to find your heart

i'm such a fool

skinny-dipping in the dark

by the banks of your dilemma, out of control
no one seems to give the answers that you wanna hear
what you'd give to find a welcome here

miles and miles of lies behind you
those were the days
so many lives you'd hope would guide you
help you find a way
now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
what you'd give to dry these bitter tears

did it come naturally?
you a million miles from home
when you tried so carefully
to live a life that's not your own
always remember that it wasn't that long ago
i stilled the oceans
i moved the mountains
to say i love you

heaven waits
the hours of silence finds you on your knees
broken in a sweet surrender of peace
all the years of searching for a love you didn't know
now you've finally found a welcome home

was full of secrets locked up tight like iron mountain
running on empty, so out of gas

thought i wasn't enough
found i wasn't so tough
laying on the bathroom floor
we were living on a fault line
and i felt the fault was all mine
couldn't take it anymore

there was no other way
i picked myself back up
i knew i had to stay
i put one foot in front of the other
and i looked in the mirror
and decided to stay
wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

i thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
when the truth was like swallowing sand
now every morning, there is no more mourning
oh i can finally see myself again

possible to be loved

known the way and still so lost?

caught in the eye of a hurricane
slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
so sick of this town pulling me down, oh

but can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
so, if i pray, am i just sending words into outer space?

have you ever been so lost?
known the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost?

is there a light
at the end of the road?

another night waiting for someone to take me home

i feel my lotus bloom, come closer
i want your energy, i want your aura

but i took up this hammer
and laughed at all your slander
and pierced your hands
with the nails of blasphemy
how could i do this? i don't know
said something forced me to it
so, spit in your face and passed you by
i'd forgotten those words "your name won't be denied"

but time and time again i'd live that life of sin
i knew it hurt you bad but i wasn't ready to give in
maybe someday, but not this day i said
i wanted to live my life i was willing to pay the price

but i took up this hammer

i needed you bad, my life was oh so sad
but looking back at all this pain, this guilt, this strife
would you take it all away if i were to give you back my life?

can anyone stay in one place
and when you get to the finish line
will you wish for more time

but see, one day
one day you will
but maybe one day you will find
that you just can't push rewind

all we have is this moment
tomorrow's unspoken
yesterday is history
so why don't you be here with me

all we have is this moment
to put a love into motion
yesterday is history
so why don't you be here with me
be here with me now

do you ever think that
we're just chasing our tails
like life is one big fast treadmill
and we pop what is prescribed
if it gets us first prize

but you know who i
who i think will win
are the ones that let love in
are the ones that take the time

all we have is this moment
tomorrow's unspoken
yesterday is history
so why don't you be here with me

all we have is this moment
to put a love into motion
yesterday is history
so why don't you be here with me
be here with me now

'cause the future is right now
right in front on you
don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
our future is right now
i'm in front of you
baby, don't blink and miss this moment

tomorrow's unspoken
yesterday is history
so why don't you be here with me

all we have is this moment
to put a love into motion
yesterday is history
so why don't you be here with me
be here with me nowi hope you hang yourself with your h&amp;m scarf
while jacking off listening to mozart
you bitch and moan about la
wishing you were in the rain reading hemingway
you don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
you're so indie rock it's almost an art
you need spf 45 just to stay alive

you're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
you're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
i'm so mean 'cause i cannot get you outta your head
i'm so angry 'cause you'd rather myspace instead
i can't believe i fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

the cherry on top,
the pick of the pack,
the de la crop,
if you want me you better do better than that tonight
oh, oh

if you want me, it takes more than a wink,
more than a drink,
more than you think,
if you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight

'cause some don't have the patience,
some call me high maintenance
but you pay the bill,
'cause that's the deal

if you wanna ride,
just name your price,
and don't play cheap with your heart,
don't make a bet if you can't write the check

for me, for me,
'cause i can be bought,
but you pay the cost,
if you can afford me

if you want me, i'm not a piece of ass,
a one night stand, a storage shed,
i think you better walk by tonight,
oh no

if you want me,
then stop begging,
i don't put out for charity
if you want me, there's no discount price tonight

but i don't need your dollar bills,
i just want something real,
'cause nothing's free,
except loving me

if you wanna ride,
just name your price,
and don't play cheap with your heart,
don't make a bet if you can't write the check

for me, for me,
'cause i can be bought,

and don't play cheap with your heart,
don't make a bet if you can't write the check

for me, for me,
'cause i can be bought,
but you pay the cost,
if you can afford me</div>i lost myself in fear of losing you
i wish i didn't do, but i did
i lost my own, my own identity
forgot that you picked me for me

but now, i don't negotiate with insecurities
they always seem to get the best of me
i found i had to love myself the way i wanted you to
love me

no more second-guessing
no, there's no more questioning
i'll be the one defining
who i'm gonna be
no concealing feelings
or changing seasonally
i'm gonna love myself the way i want you to
love me

sometimes i wish my skin was a costume
that i could just unzip and strip
but who i am is who i'm meant to be
and it's who you're in love, in love with

so now, i don't negotiate with insecurities
they're going to have to take a back seat
i know i have to love myself the way i want you to
love me

no more second-guessing
no, there's no more questioning
i'll be the one defining
who i'm gonna be
no concealing feelings
or changing seasonally
i'm gonna love myself the way i want you to
love me

no more standing in my own way
let's go deeper, let's get closer
the way i want you to love me

no more standing in my own way
let's go deeper, let's get closer
the way i want you to love me

no more second-guessing
no, there's no more questioning
i'll be the one defining
who i'm gonna be
no concealing feelings
or changing seasonally
i'm gonna love myself the way i want you to
love me

no more second-guessing
no, there's no more questioning
i'll be the one defining
who i'm gonna be
no concealing feelings
or changing seasonally
i'm gonna love myself the way i want you to
love meyou could throw me in the fire
and i won't be burned
for my faith is your desire
and your love endures

you could throw me in the prison cell
shackle me up against the rail
but time and time again
my faith won't fail

for he'll prevail
in the midst of all my trials and tribulations
and he'll prevail
in the midst of all my sin and temptations
he'll prevail
when i fail and he will pick me up
for time and time again my faith won't fail

you could throw me in the lion's den
but they won't harm me
for your grace surrounds me
and it sets me free

and i can walk upon the water
and i will not drown
for my eyes are set upon you
and no one can bring me down

for he'll prevail
in the midst of all my trials and tribulations
and he'll prevail
in the midst of all my sin and temptations
he'll prevail
when i fail and he will pick me up
for time and time again my faith won't fail

for his angels surround me
and you've poured out this blood covering
and i will walk and not fail
for time and time again my faith won't fail

for he'll prevail
in the midst of all my trials and tribulations
and he'll prevail
in the midst of all my sin and temptations
he'll prevail
when i fail and he will pick me up
for time and time again my faith won't fail
